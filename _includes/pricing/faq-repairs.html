              All businesses that do business with Grove need to have an established Apple Business number with Apple directly for ordering. Don't have one? No problem, we can help you get one. Once done we will help get you setup with a Custom Apple Store and an Apple Business Manager account to help facilitate purchases.

             As an Apple Certified Consultancy we believe that the best experience with purchasing Apple hardware is through the official Apple Business channel. Apple Business Manager helps protect your purchases and ensure that they are enrolled into a platform that can be integrated with a management tool that you can implement for your business.

              After you purchase a computer from Apple for your business you need to have an MDM to help manage those devices. No matter if you have just 1 device or a fleet of 100, you need to ensure that you are able to manage them, remotely wipe them and provision them for new hires at your company. We work with JAMF, Mosyle, Kandji and more.

              I don't want to purchase devices myself, can you just do it for me?

             Grove Technologies is not an authorized reseller so we can't purchase devices on behalf of our clients. We can however propose solutions that make sense for our clients needs and help them facilitate the purchase via their Online Custom Apple Store. In this way we ensure that the client gets the equipment they need.
