I"´<p>For those of you who know me well, know that I love technology. Not just Apple products which I inherently love because of my love for creative pursuits but any new technology where I feel connected. A few such products hit the kickstarter / funding phase a while back, <a href="https://lockitron.com">Lockitron</a> and <a href="https://onlycoin.com">Coin</a>. Many hear the words <a href="https://lockitron.com">Lockitron</a> and cringe, I know I do, because I paid for the product over four years ago, and have yet to see an actual product ship. Not seeing a product ship seemed inevitable for <a href="https://onlycoin.com">Coin</a> as well until I got mine in the mail last week.</p>
