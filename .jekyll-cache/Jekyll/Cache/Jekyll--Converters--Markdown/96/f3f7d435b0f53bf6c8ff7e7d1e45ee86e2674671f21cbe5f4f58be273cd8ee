I"F<p>On the Mac, scroll bars are essential for both orienting yourself and
navigating within a Web page or document window. But they may not appear
unless you hover the pointer over the right spot or start scrolling with
a gesture on a trackpad or a turn of a mouse scroll wheel. If that
bothers you, go to System Preferences &gt; General and under Show Scroll
Bars, select Always. That way, scroll bars will always be visible
without you having to guess where they are or perform some incantation
to reveal them.</p>
