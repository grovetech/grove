I"æ<p>If like me you use iCloud Drive across your devices that is Windows Laptops, iPads, iPhones, and Macs you may have noticed with the iOS 11 update this is now called ‚ÄúFiles‚Äù.</p>

<p>Other than the fact Apple has changed the name from Drive to Files (at least 20 minutes lost googling what happened to my iCloud Drive) there is nothing I don‚Äôt like about Files in iOS 11.</p>

<p>It‚Äôs easier to use, it integrates with Google Drive, Dropbox, OneDrive, Adobe Creative Cloud and more. Files also supports macOS Servers, if like me you run a macOS file server and webserver it‚Äôs a giant leap in turns of cloud storage across Apple‚Äôs Operating Systems. Here is the low down on the new App.</p>

<p>Location(s): such as iCloud, Google Drive, macOS server etc:</p>

<p>Favorites: These are folders that you manually add to favorites (keep on reading for the how to)</p>

<p>Tags: these are shared across iCloud, so the same Tags you use on your Mac and iDevice‚Äôs will show up here.</p>

<h3 id="recently-deleted">Recently Deleted</h3>

<p>This allows you to quickly restore files that you have deleted by accident, the time the files you delete appear in recently deleted is limited!</p>

<p>Although Google Drives works very well with this feature some other Cloud storage providers do not integrate with this feature yet, and so deleted files may disappear immediately.</p>
