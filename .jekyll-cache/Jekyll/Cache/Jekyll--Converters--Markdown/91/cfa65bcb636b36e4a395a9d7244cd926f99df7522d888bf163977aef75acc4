I"^<p>Although Macs are great at managing their energy use which allows
MacBooks to maximise the time they are able to run from battery power
alone, there are situations in which you may wish to extend their energy
efficiency even more.</p>

<p>The Intel CPU running in your Mac that’s the i number usually from i3
through i9 in the current Mac line-up supports [Intel Turbo
Boost which accelerates processor and graphics performance for peak
loads, automatically allowing processor cores to run faster than the
rated operating frequency.</p>

<p>Intel Turbo Boost, unlike manually overclocking a processor, is
designed to avoid overheating by throttling the performance (speed) of
the processor when the temperature gets too high.</p>

<p>You can see the current base speed of your processor by going to
Apple Menu &gt; About This Mac:</p>

<p><img alt="Blog Photo" src="https://grovetech.co/assets/img/blog/2020/2020092827/image4.png" class="img-fluid rounded m-2" width="700" /></p>

<p>On this Mac we can see the processor base speed is 3.69 Ghz, and if we
go to <a href="https://everymac.com">https://everymac.com</a> and
search for the Mac Pro (Late 2013) we can see on its stats page the
processor in the <a href="https://everymac.com/systems/apple/mac_pro/specs/mac-pro-quad-core-3.7-xeon-e5-gray-black-cylinder-late-2013-specs.html">Mac supports a Turbo Speed of 3.9Ghz</a>.</p>

<p>If you like to track your Macs and their specs there is also a nice
little app available in the <a href="https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/mactracker/id430255202?mt=12">App Store called Mac Tracker</a>.</p>

<p>When Intel Turbo Boost Technology kicks in and your processor starts
running at the higher clock speed your Mac will start to consume more
power, naturally if this is on a MacBook and you are not plugged into a
charger then your battery life will be shortened.</p>

<p>If you don’t need this automatic power increase and would like to
extend your battery life there is a great App called Turbo Boost
Switcher which you can use to limit the Turbo Boost technology
universally. In testing I saw a 10% saving in power usage on my MacBook
which could equate to an additional 1 hour of battery life.</p>

<p>Using the web and word processing I saw no impact on performance, while
playing games and using iMovie disabling Turbo boost made my MacBook
noticeably slower.</p>

<p><strong>How to use Turbo Boost Switcher</strong></p>

<p>I’m using the free version in this tutorial however I’d recommend
purchasing the Pro version if you find the free version useful as it has
the extra features:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Auto modes based on fan speed, battery status, apps running and more!</li>
  <li>Fully customizable status bar</li>
  <li>Enter root password just once</li>
  <li>Auto disable Turbo Boost when not charging</li>
  <li>OSX Notifications integration</li>
  <li>Display Temps on ºC and ºF</li>
  <li>Free updates forever</li>
</ul>

<p>After installing the app which is available <a href="http://tbswitcher.rugarciap.com">here</a>
a new menu item will be added to the top right of the
screen:</p>

<p>Clicking on this menu will open up the Turbo Switcher App which allows
you to enable and disable the Turbo mode of your intel CPU, as well as
monitor CPU load, fan speed if available &amp; the temperature of the
CPU.</p>

<p><img alt="Blog Photo" src="https://grovetech.co/assets/img/blog/2020/2020092827/image2.png" class="img-fluid rounded m-2" width="400" /></p>

<p>The option to “Disable Turbo Boost” is the main option of the app and
doing so will save on power usage.</p>

<p>You can monitor the power savings in the “Charts…” menu:</p>

<p>So, there you have it, enjoy saving around 10% power
usage when the turbo mode would normally kick in, however do remember if
you are using power intensive Apps or Games you may want tore-enable Turbo mode so you don’t get any stuttering or slowing of your
Mac.</p>
