<hr />

<p>When you use Apple’s Mail app on your iPhone to send email, the default
signature is “Sent from my iPhone.” If you’d rather not advertise that
fact with every email, or would prefer to change it to something more
personal, don’t bother poking around in the Mail app itself. Instead, go
to Settings &gt; Mail &gt; Signature, where you can change the signature to
anything you like or delete it entirely. If you have multiple email
accounts configured, such as one for work and one for home, you can also
set a different signature for each.</p>
