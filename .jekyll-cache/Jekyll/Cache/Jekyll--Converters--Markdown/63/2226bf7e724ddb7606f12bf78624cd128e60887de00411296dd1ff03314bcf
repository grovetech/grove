I"ö<p>A new feature of Messages in both iOS 14 and macOS 11 Big Sur is the
option to pin up to nine conversations at the top of the conversation
list for easy access. No longer do you have to worry about them
scrolling out of sight. On an iPhone or iPad, touch and hold a
conversation and tap Pin in the menu that appears; on a Mac,
Control-click the conversation and choose Pin. (Remove them by repeating
the action and choosing Unpin.) Each of your devices can have different
conversations pinned. If you are used to scanning the left side of
Messages for blue new-message indicators, also be sure to look for those
blue dots amongst your pinned icons at the top of the screen. Also, note
that on the Mac, it can be a little too easy to see a notification
banner about a new message, switch to Messages, and type in the
currently selected (but wrong) conversation.</p>
