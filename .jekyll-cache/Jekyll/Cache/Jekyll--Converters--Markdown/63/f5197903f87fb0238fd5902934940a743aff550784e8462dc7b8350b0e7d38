I"9<p>We’ve been hearing reports of an uptick in the scam phone calls that
claim to be from Apple. If you answer, an automated message tells you
that your iCloud account has been breached and asks you to call a
provided 1-866 number. <strong>Do not do this!</strong> Apple will never call you
unprompted. Unfortunately, the criminals behind this particular phishing
attack are spoofing Apple’s phone numbers effectively, so the call looks
legitimate. Be very careful about which unrecognized phone calls you
answer, and if you’re ever asked for personal information like a bank
account or credit card number during such a call, hang up, look up the
institution’s phone number elsewhere, and verify with someone at that
number rather than one provided by the caller.</p>
