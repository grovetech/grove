I"Œ<p>For many people, increasing vaccination rates mean that long-delayed
vacations are now possible, and in-person conferences are slowly
starting up again too. But before you head out for the beach or the
convention center, you‚Äôll want to write an out-of-office email
auto-reply message to send to everyone who tries to get in touch while
you‚Äôre away. A bit of thought upfront could reduce stress for your
correspondents‚Äîand ensure that they don‚Äôt hunt you down for that
burning question.</p>

<p>Before we look at what information should be in an effective
out-of-office message, a quick tip. Don‚Äôt create a custom rule in Mail
or another email app that automatically replies to every message. It is
too easy to end up sending replies to every message from a mailing list
or to an address that will itself reply back, causing a mail loop where
each message generates another reply, ad infinitum. Plus, the Mac has to
stay turned on and active while you‚Äôre gone or else it will do nothing
while you‚Äôre gone and then reply to everything when you return to work
and turn it on! Instead, set up such auto-responders in the server
settings for your email provider, which are better about avoiding mail
loops. Here are instructions for

<p>The key to writing an out-of-office message that satisfies your
correspondents is to put yourself in their shoes. What information are
they likely to want from you? How will they react when they learn you‚Äôre
away? Do the answers to these questions vary with different audiences?</p>

<p>There‚Äôs no single perfect out-of-office message, but while crafting
yours, we strongly recommend including‚Äîor at least considering‚Äîall
the following information.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Reason for the trip:</strong> Significant detail isn‚Äôt necessary, but
there‚Äôs a big difference between being on vacation and at a
conference. You may be too busy to read and reply to email quickly
at the conference, but you‚Äôre probably not entirely unavailable, as
you would be while canoeing in the Canadian wilderness. Being candid
helps set expectations.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Location:</strong> Sharing your rough location may be helpful if you‚Äôre
semi-available but in a radically different time zone. It can also
sometimes lead to happy coincidences when a contact realizes you‚Äôre
in their city. But if you‚Äôre trying to unplug and get away, there‚Äôs
no need to get specific.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Availability:</strong> Some of the time, the answer is easy‚Äîyou‚Äôre
unavailable. But if you‚Äôre semi-available or available in case of
emergency, try to set expectations appropriately for how much you
want to handle versus sending to colleagues.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Dates:</strong> Always include the date range you‚Äôll be gone. Many things
can wait, and if your correspondent sees you‚Äôll be back on the 17th,
they may just shrug and make a reminder to respond to you after
that. Others will realize that they need to scramble on different
plans right away.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Alternative contacts:</strong> Who‚Äôs picking up the slack while you‚Äôre
gone, or who can help in case of emergency? Put some thought into
the different sets of people who send you email and write simple
IF/THEN sentences directing them to the right person. ‚ÄúIf you need
help with print production, contact John Gutenberg at
ppress\@example.org.‚Äù Needless to say, always ask those people if
they can field questions about your responsibilities first, in case
they‚Äôre overscheduled or planning to be away too. If you find
yourself listing lots of people, see if you can instead designate a
single primary contact.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Provide contact info:</strong> Unless you‚Äôre in a large organization with
a corporate directory and don‚Äôt communicate with outsiders much,
you‚Äôll want to provide at least an email address, perhaps along with
a phone number, for each of the contacts you list.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>FAQs:</strong> If many of your email questions can be answered with a
pointer to a Web page, consider using such links instead of
alternative contacts. Correspondents might be happier if a page
provided the necessary answer rather than having to wait for a reply
from another person.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Here are a few more general tips:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Keep the message short and sweet.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Stay positive‚Äîit‚Äôs a good opportunity to praise an assistant or
colleague‚Äîand be careful with humor since you never quite know how
others will take it.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Don‚Äôt promise to reply within a particular time frame after you get
back. Even if that‚Äôs your plan, airline flights can get canceled,
you might return with a bad case of the flu, or something else might
conspire to delay your reply.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Edit carefully to make sure email addresses and phone numbers are
correct and to eliminate typos. You don‚Äôt know who might send you
email while you‚Äôre gone, and if it were the head of your company, a
key supplier, or a potential investor, such mistakes wouldn‚Äôt do
your career any favors.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If your email service doesn‚Äôt let you set an automatic end date,
remember to turn off your out-of-office message as soon as you get
back!</p>
  </li>
</ul>
