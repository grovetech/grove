I"‡<p>So the Tech world‚Äôs software giant has released a version of its web
browser for MacOs again after a 17-year absence. It‚Äôs actually big news
as the last time a Web Browser from Microsoft was available on the Mac
it was Internet Explorer 5 which saw the end of a 5 year partnership
between Apple &amp; Microsoft where Internet Explorer was bundled with MacOs
and was the default browser.</p>

<p>Following several years of antitrust actions against Microsoft for
bundling their web browser with their operating system &amp; Apple‚Äôs
announcement it was going to launch its own Safari in 2003 Microsoft
effectively cancelled any updates to Internet Explorer for
Macintosh.</p>

<p>Why do we care? What‚Äôs going to be good about Edge for Mac?</p>

<p>Well you can almost guarantee that the latest creative project you are
completing for your client is about to be viewed on a Windows PC that
will have Edge installed. So you‚Äôll want to make sure it looks great &amp;
can be presented in Edge.</p>

<p>Microsoft launching a new version of Edge for Mac shows a renewed
interest in the Macintosh market, which is only good news for us, Mac
users.</p>

<p>What‚Äôs different in ‚Äúnew‚Äù Edge is the shift to the Chromium engine,
which incidentally also powers Google Chrome &amp; many other apps. This
could make developing extensions for ‚Äúnew‚Äù Edge easier, and provide a
unified experience for developers / designers &amp; users alike.</p>

<p><strong>So what are the features?</strong></p>

<p>The ‚ÄúCollections‚Äù feature will be used to collect web content for
research which should then be easy to export to Word , Excel or any of
the other Microsoft programs (sorry they also call them apps now) I mean
Apps.</p>

<p>Microsoft has also rebranded the logo for ‚Äúnew‚Äù Edge. The ‚ÄúE‚Äù has been
dropped in favour of a wave that is presumably to differentiate between
Internet Explorer and ‚Äúnew‚Äù Edge.</p>

<p>Microsoft is pushing the benefits of Edge‚Äôs privacy &amp; safe browsing
features which seems to be one of the main benefits of this browser for
Mac.</p>

<p>These include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Tracking prevention by default (this is becoming more common with all
browsers)</li>
  <li>SmartScreen and Tracking Prevention (phishing, PuPs, malware,
viruses)</li>
  <li>InPrivate prevent web searches being pinned to a user (think incognito
for Chrome)</li>
  <li>First off to download Edge for MacOs you will have to visit (as it is
not in the Mac App store yet):<br />
<a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/edge">https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/edge</a></li>
  <li>From here you can start the 150Mb download, interestingly nearly double
the size of the Chrome download. You‚Äôll need to open the pkg installer
from your Downloads folder in order to start the install.</li>
</ul>

<p>It looks like Edge will be compatible with MacOs 10.12 (Sierra) and
above.</p>

<p>Of course the first thing the new Edge browser will ask if you would
like to import your settings like every other browser
available.</p>

<p>One slightly annoying thing is Edge will only run full screen at first
until you have filled in all the information it asks for at set
up.</p>

<p><img alt="Blog Photo" src="https://grovetech.co/assets/img/blog/2020/20200514In/image10.png" class="img-fluid rounded m-2" width="800" /></p>

<p>Once you are in, Microsoft has provided a run down of all the latest
features; again they are really pushing the privacy features of the
‚Äúnew‚Äù Edge browser.</p>

<p><img alt="Blog Photo" src="https://grovetech.co/assets/img/blog/2020/20200514In/image7.png" class="img-fluid rounded m-2" width="800" /></p>

<p>So let's take a look at these browser Privacy &amp; security
features.</p>

<p><strong>Personal Profiles:</strong></p>

<p>Similarly to Chrome Edge will allow you to create more than one user
profile allowing you to switch between the different profiles for the
people who use your computer.</p>

<p><img alt="Blog Photo" src="https://grovetech.co/assets/img/blog/2020/20200514In/image3.png" class="img-fluid rounded m-2" width="400" /></p>

<p>This keeps your saved passwords, banking information, browsing history
and other settings separate. You may have more than one Microsoft
account, one for work &amp; one for personal for example.</p>

<p><strong>Guest &amp; Private browsing:</strong></p>

<p>Edge allows you to browse in private mode they called it,,, drum roll
please ‚ÄúinPrivate‚Äù just like every other browser out there all be it
named differently, which will delete your browsing history once you
close the private windows. Edge also offers ‚Äúguest‚Äù browsing which will
delete all your browsing history once you have closed the guest
session:</p>

<p><img alt="Blog Photo" src="https://grovetech.co/assets/img/blog/2020/20200514In/image6.png" class="img-fluid rounded m-2" width="400" /></p>

<p><strong>Tracking prevention:</strong></p>

<p>To access the settings menu you‚Äôll want to click on the three dots in
the top right of the window, compared to Chrome these have been set
horizontally.</p>

<p><img alt="Blog Photo" src="https://grovetech.co/assets/img/blog/2020/20200514In/image11.png" class="img-fluid rounded m-2" width="400" /></p>

<p>From here you will want to choose ‚ÄúPrivacy and Services‚Äù.</p>

<p>Edge has conveniently provided three default options for Tracking
Prevention, Basic, Balanced, &amp; Strict. There‚Äôs a list of sites that have
been blocked from tracking you as well as the ability to add exceptions
to certain sites to allow them to track you.</p>

<p><img alt="Blog Photo" src="https://grovetech.co/assets/img/blog/2020/20200514In/image4.png" class="img-fluid rounded m-2" width="800" /></p>

<p>In this same menu you will find the familiar Clear browsing data which
allows you to choose what will be cleared &amp; also provides the ability to
choose which items are cleared each time you close Edge, which itself is
a handy feature.</p>

<p><strong>Malware Protection</strong></p>

<p>If you scroll down a little further on the ‚ÄúPrivacy and Services‚Äù
screen there are two options that actively protect your Mac and Web
Browser from Malware and unwanted apps often referred to as PuPs
(Potentially unwanted Programs).</p>

<p>The SmartScreen service is enabled by default, and you may want to also
enable ‚ÄúBlock potentially unwanted apps‚Äù.</p>

<p><img alt="Blog Photo" src="https://grovetech.co/assets/img/blog/2020/20200514In/image1.png" class="img-fluid rounded m-2" width="800" /></p>

<p>It will be interesting to see the Mac community‚Äôs reaction to Edge or
‚Äúnew‚Äù Edge or ‚Äúnew new‚Äù Internet Explorer or whatever name takes your
fancy.</p>

<p>It looks like a solid offering from Microsoft, Edge runs fast on the
Mac and with the new Privacy &amp; security features Microsoft could be onto
a winner with Edge for Mac.</p>
