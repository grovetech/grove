I"à<p>You probably fall into one of two camps: people who havenâ€™t the foggiest
idea what pressing Command-Shift-3 or Command-Shift-4 do on the Mac, and
those who use those keyboard shortcuts regularly to take screenshots.
Either way, macOS 10.14 Mojave makes it easier than ever to create a
still image of whatâ€™s on your Macâ€™s screen and to record a video of
actions you take on the screen. (And donâ€™t worry, the old shortcuts
still work just as they always have.)</p>

<p>For those who arenâ€™t screenshot takers, why would you want to? The big
reason is to share something youâ€™re looking at, perhaps to send a friend
a map to where in a park you want to meet or to tell tech support about
the error dialog you keep getting. And a screen recording is a great way
to show an employee how to perform a task without having to write it all
up.</p>

<p>To start with Mojaveâ€™s new tools, press Command-Shift-5 and look at the
controls that appear in a floating control bar. (If you open it
accidentally, click the X button or press Escape to close it.)</p>

<h3 id="screenshots">Screenshots</h3>
<hr />
<p>The first three buttons help you take screenshots, with a few welcome
enhancements over the Macâ€™s longstanding screenshot capabilities. The
resulting screenshot will always be in PNG format.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Capture Entire Screen:</strong> Click the first button and then click
anywhere to make a screenshot of the entire screen. If you have a
second monitor attached to your Mac, you can click anywhere on that
screen to capture it instead.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Capture Selected Window:</strong> To focus on a particular window, click
the second button and then click the camera pointer on the desired
window. This also works with dialogs and menus; make sure theyâ€™re
visible before invoking the screenshot controls. A tip: press the
Option key when clicking the camera pointer to capture the object
without its drop shadow.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Capture Selected Portion:</strong> What if neither of those is quite
right? Click the third button, drag out, position, and resize the
selection rectangle over the spot you want, and click Capture on the
control bar. Note how the rectangle shows the dimensions of the
image it will create as you resizeâ€”that can be useful.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Thereâ€™s also an Options menu on the control bar. Click it to choose
which folder or app should receive the screenshot and if you need a 5-
or 10-second timer to get the screen looking right first. You can also
choose to show a floating thumbnail of the screenshot in the lower-right
corner of the screen for quick markup or trashing, remember the size and
location of the selection rectangle, and show the pointer in the
screenshot.</p>

<h3 id="screen-recordings">Screen Recordings</h3>
<hr />
<p>The fourth and fifth buttons are for creating screen recordings, and
theyâ€™re similar to the screen capture choices. When you select one of
them, the contents of the Options menu change, and the Capture button
changes to Record. The movie will always be a QuickTime movie using the
H.264 codec.</p>

<p><img src="https://grovetech.co/assets/img/blog/2018/mojavescreens/image4.png" class="img-fluid rounded m-2" width="750" /></p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Record Entire Screen:</strong> Click the fourth button and then Record to
start recording actions on the entire screen.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Record Selected Portion:</strong> The problem with recording the entire
screen is that the resulting file can get big. To focus on a small
area of the screen, click the fifth button. Then drag out, position,
and resize the rectangle in which the recording will take place, and
finally, click Record.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>However you start a recording, you can stop it in one of two ways. A
stop button always appears on the menu bar; click it to finish and save
the recording. On a smaller laptop screen, itâ€™s possible for the menu
bar button to be obscured, so hereâ€™s an alternative method: press
Command-Shift-5 again, and the recording controls are replaced by a stop
button.</p>

<p><img src="https://grovetech.co/assets/img/blog/2018/mojavescreens/image5.png" class="img-fluid rounded m-2" width="750" /></p>

<p>You can record yourself speaking while you make a movie of whatâ€™s
happening on the screen. To do that, open the Options menu and choose
Built-in Microphone. Another special movie recording option is Show
Mouse Clicks, which puts a dark circle around the pointer in the
recording whenever you click.</p>

<p><img src="https://grovetech.co/assets/img/blog/2018/mojavescreens/image6.png" class="img-fluid rounded m-2" width="750" /></p>

<p>Thatâ€™s it! Mojaveâ€™s new screenshot and screen recording controls offer
more options and are easier to use than the previous techniques, as long
as you remember the Command-Shift-5 keyboard shortcut to bring them up.
Practice that a few times, and youâ€™ll be ready the next time you want to
capture a funny dialog or strange occurrence on your Mac.</p>
