I"Â<p>For many years, Macs have relied on sets of keys held at startup to
enable specific modes. Most notably, pressing Option displays the
Startup Manager and lets you pick a boot drive, Command-R starts up from
macOS Recovery, Command-Option-P-R resets the NVRAM, Shift starts up in
Safe mode, D opens Apple Diagnostics to check the hardware, and T starts
up in Target Disk Mode. Needless to say, obscure key combinations aren‚Äôt
the friendliest way to help someone who may already be stressed out
about their Mac not working, so Apple improved things for the new
M1-based Macs.</p>

<p>The most important part is that you no longer have to press a key
combination during startup. Instead, press and hold the power button
until the screen shows ‚ÄúLoading startup options‚Ä¶‚Äù and displays the
Startup Manager.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, Apple is still a little fast and loose with terms, so
we‚Äôve tried to list all of the ones you might see.‚Äã</p>

<h3 id="startup-manager--startup-disk">Startup Manager / Startup Disk</h3>

<p>If you have multiple boot drives and wish to switch among them, you‚Äôll
want to use Startup Manager. Immediately after you see ‚ÄúLoading startup
options‚Ä¶,‚Äù the Mac displays the new Startup Manager, which shows icons
for all the bootable drives, along with buttons for Options, Shut Down,
and Restart. To boot from a particular drive, select it and click
Continue under it.</p>

<p>If you work your way into macOS Recovery but then want to back out in
order to select a startup drive, look in the Apple menu for a Startup
Disk command, which provides similar functionality with a slightly
different look.</p>

<p><img alt="Blog Photo" src="https://grovetech.co/assets/img/blog/2020/20210104M1/image3.jpeg" class="img-fluid rounded m-2" width="700" /></p>

<p>Startup Manager (but not Startup Disk) also lets you start up in Safe
mode and set a drive as the default to use for booting. First, select a
drive. Then, for Safe mode, press the Shift key and click the Continue
in Safe Mode button below it. To set a selected drive as the default,
press the Control or Option key and click the Always Use button
underneath it.</p>

<p>Note that M1-based Macs can‚Äôt boot from just any external drive. We‚Äôre
all still learning about the new platform, but it seems that you need a
Thunderbolt 3 SSD that has been freshly formatted with APFS and set up
with a new installation of macOS 11.1 Big Sur. See <a href="https://eclecticlight.co/2020/12/22/booting-an-m1-mac-from-an-external-disk-it-is-possible/">Howard Oakley‚Äôs
writeup</a>
for details.‚Äã</p>

<h3 id="macos-recovery--recovery">macOS Recovery / Recovery</h3>

<p>When you need to reinstall macOS or restore from a Time Machine backup,
head to macOS Recovery. From the Startup Manager screen, select Options
and click Continue underneath it. After you choose a language, an
initial macOS Recovery screen appears. Note that you have access to the
Apple menu, which lets you choose Startup Disk, Restart, or Shut Down,
and to the Recovery Assistant menu, which includes a potentially useful
Erase Mac command.</p>

<p><img alt="Blog Photo" src="https://grovetech.co/assets/img/blog/2020/20210104M1/image4jpeg" class="img-fluid rounded m-2" width="700" /></p>

<p>macOS Recovery presents you with a list of users. Select one for which
you know the login password, click Next, and enter the password when
prompted. Now, in the Recovery app, you can restore from Time Machine,
reinstall Big Sur, launch Safari to browse the Web and get online help
from Apple, and open Disk Utility to manage drives.</p>

<p><img alt="Blog Photo" src="https://grovetech.co/assets/img/blog/2020/20210104M1/image5.jpeg" class="img-fluid rounded m-2" width="700" /></p>

<p>The Recovery app has a full set of menus, and notice Utilities in
particular. It lets you launch the Startup Security Utility, to reduce
the macOS security level, or Terminal, if you want to run command-line
tools before startup. (The old macOS single-user mode accessible by
holding down S at startup has disappeared.) To return to the Recovery
app from any other app, quit the current app. Finally, note that the
Recovery app‚Äôs Window menu has an option for Recovery Log. As is often
the case with logs, it may be inscrutable to all but high-level support
experts.</p>

<p>Oddly, once you‚Äôre in macOS Recovery, there‚Äôs no way to return to the
Startup Manager.</p>

<h3 id="target-disk-mode--share-disk">Target Disk Mode / Share Disk</h3>

<p>If you ever want to access one Mac‚Äôs drives from another, you can
connect the two Macs via a USB or Thunderbolt cable and use Target Disk
Mode. On M1-based Macs, you initiate Target Disk Mode using a command in
the Recovery app‚Äôs Utilities menu: Share Disk.</p>

<p>Choose Utilities &gt; Share Disk to start sharing one of the M1-based
Mac‚Äôs drives via Target Disk Mode. Select the drive and click Start
Sharing. When you‚Äôre done using it, click Stop Sharing before
disconnecting the cable.</p>

<p><img alt="Blog Photo" src="https://grovetech.co/assets/img/blog/2020/20210104M1/image7.jpeg" class="img-fluid rounded m-2" width="700" /></p>

<h3 id="apple-diagnostics--diagnostics-loader">Apple Diagnostics / Diagnostics Loader</h3>

<p>If you‚Äôre worried that your M1-based Mac is suffering from a hardware
failure, running Apple Diagnostics may shed some light on the problem.
Oddly, getting to Apple Diagnostics still requires a hidden keystroke.</p>

<p>Once you‚Äôre in the Startup Manager screen, press and hold Command-D to
reboot the Mac into the Diagnostics Loader app. You can choose to run
the diagnostics offline or to share the information with Apple.</p>

<p><img alt="Blog Photo" src="https://grovetech.co/assets/img/blog/2020/20210104M1/image8.jpeg" class="img-fluid rounded m-2" width="700" /></p>

<p>After you pick one, the diagnostics run right away and report back when
they‚Äôre done. If you have an M1-based MacBook Air or MacBook Pro, make
sure to plug it in first, or you‚Äôll get an error telling you that the
power adapter couldn‚Äôt be found.</p>

<p><img alt="Blog Photo" src="https://grovetech.co/assets/img/blog/2020/20210104M1/image9.jpeg" class="img-fluid rounded m-2" width="700" /></p>

<p>The troubleshooting approaches that no longer seem to be available in
any way are to reset the NVRAM (Non-Volatile RAM) or the SMC (System
Management Controller). Apparently, the NVRAM tests itself at startup
and resets automatically if necessary. M1-based Macs reportedly don‚Äôt
have an SMC in the same way as Intel-based Macs, so there‚Äôs no option to
reset it.</p>
