I"ê<p>Even as we get 5G cellular connectivity and high-speed Wi-Fi networks,
there are plenty of times when you might want to reduce your data usage.
Perhaps you‚Äôre trying to avoid running over a data cap while traveling,
or maybe you‚Äôre sharing a Wi-Fi network with a very slow Internet
connection. Either way, you can prevent your iPhone from using more data
than necessary by enabling Low Data Mode. For cellular, find the switch
in Settings &gt; Cellular &gt; Cellular Data Options. For Wi-Fi, in Settings</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Wi-Fi, tap the i button next to the network you‚Äôre using. In either
case, make sure to turn Low Data Mode off once you no longer need it to
avoid getting confused about why background sync tasks don‚Äôt complete.</p>
