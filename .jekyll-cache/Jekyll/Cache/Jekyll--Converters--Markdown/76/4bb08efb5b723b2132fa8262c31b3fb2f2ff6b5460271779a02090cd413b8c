I"Ñ<p>In July 2017, Adobe announced that it would <a href="https://www.adobe.com/products/flashplayer/end-of-life.html">stop distributing and
updating Flash
Player</a> on
December 31st, 2020. Web standards like HTML5 provide a viable
alternative to Flash content, and organizations that relied on Flash
have had three years to replace it. Because Adobe will no longer be
addressing security vulnerabilities in Flash with updates, Flash Player
now prompts users to uninstall. We strongly recommend doing soâ€”just
click the Uninstall button if you get this alert. If you donâ€™t, a Flash
Player Install Manager app in your Utilities folder should be able to
remove Flash Player as well. Adobe also provides <a href="https://helpx.adobe.com/flash-player/kb/uninstall-flash-player-mac-os.html">instructions to
uninstall
manually</a>.</p>
