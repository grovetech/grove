I"≠<p>Business email compromises (BEC) scams made a big statement in 2018,
seeing a 133% increase over 2017, according to a
recent¬†<a href="https://www.beazley.com/news/2019/beazley_breach_briefing_2019.html" rel="nofollow">report</a>¬†by

<p>The Beazley Breach Briefing looked at information gathered from
investigations into more than 3,300 data incidents that were reported to
Beazley in 2018.</p>

<p>The investigations revealed that nearly half (47%) of the data incidents
investigated were the result of a hack or malware. Diving deeper, the
investigations revealed that half of those hacking or malware incidents
were BEC scams.</p>

<p><strong>What is a BEC scam?</strong></p>

<p>BEC scams, also known as CEO fraud, have become a favorite for
cybercriminals. A BEC scam requires the scammer to do their homework by
using social engineering tactics to determine who the CEO or CFO is, and
who the victims will be. Despite the effort it takes to make this scam
successful, cybercriminals favor it due to the high profits it yields,
even if only a few attempts are successful.</p>

<p>Typically, the scammer will target an employee working in the finance
department, or one who would not find a request for a money transfer
unusual. Then, the cybercriminal sends a fraudulent email to their
victim, impersonating the CEO or CFO requesting a wire transfer. These
emails often have a sense of urgency for the transfer and may state that
the ‚ÄúCEO or CFO‚Äù who is sending the email, is in an important business
meeting and cannot be bothered.</p>

<p>BEC scams can be tricky to detect. Scammers will often create an email
address very similar to the individual they are impersonating. In some
cases, scammers may even have control of the CEO‚Äôs or CFO‚Äôs actual email
account, making the scam even more convincing.</p>

<p>The goal of the scam is to trick the victim into performing the
requested function (most often a wire-transfer or electronic payment to
the criminal‚Äôs bank account but could include transferring sensitive
data) as quickly as possible without giving it a second thought.</p>
