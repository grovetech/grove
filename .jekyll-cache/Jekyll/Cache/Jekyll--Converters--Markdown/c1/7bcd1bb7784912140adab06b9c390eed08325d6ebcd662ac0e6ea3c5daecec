I"9<p>Apple’s workhorse desktop Mac, <a href="https://www.apple.com/imac/">the 27-inch iMac with Retina 5K
display</a>, hasn’t seen an
update since March 2019—nearly a year and a half ago. Happily, the
company has finally released a new version of the popular iMac,
outfitting it with 10th-generation Intel processors, increasing its RAM
and storage capacities, and improving its audio and video capabilities.
Prices haven’t changed, with the low-end model starting at $1799, the
mid-range model at $1999, and the high-end configuration at $2299.</p>

<p>Separately, although Apple didn’t update either the 21.5-inch iMac or
the iMac Pro, it tweaked both of their configurations. The company
finally stopped selling the small, inexpensive 21.5-inch iMac with a
performance-robbing hard drive. It now comes with SSDs standard across
the line, with a 1 TB Fusion Drive as an alternative. For the iMac Pro,
Apple dropped the 8-core Intel Xeon W processor configuration, making
the base model a 10-core processor configuration.</p>

<p>There are no industrial design changes this time around, unsurprisingly,
but the rest of the enhancements will be extremely welcome to anyone who
has been holding out for a new iMac.</p>

<h3 id="faster-processors">Faster Processors</h3>

<p>For those who are concerned about performance but don’t want to spend
thousands more on an iMac Pro or Mac Pro, Apple increased the 27-inch
iMac’s specs in noteworthy ways. You have choices of four of the latest
10th-generation Intel Core processors: a 3.1 GHz 6-core i5, a 3.3 GHz
6-core i5, a 3.8 GHz 8-core i7, and a 3.6 GHz 10-core i9. Performance
and cost both rise through that list.</p>

<h3 id="higher-performance-graphics-chips">Higher Performance Graphics Chips</h3>

<p>Apple also moved to the next-generation AMD Radeon Pro graphics chips,
with the Radeon Pro 5300 with 4 GB of memory in the low-end and
mid-range models. The high-end model starts with a Radeon Pro 5500 XT
with 8 GB of memory, and you can upgrade to a Radeon Pro 5700 with 8 GB
for $300 or a Radeon Pro 5700 XT with 16 GB for $500. The more
expensive options would be useful for graphics-intensive workflows,
complex video editing, or developing 3D content.</p>

<h3 id="higher-ram-ceiling">Higher RAM Ceiling</h3>

<p>All configurations of the 27-inch iMac start with 8 GB, but you can
expand that to 16 GB ($200), 32 GB ($600), 64 GB ($1000) or, for the
first time in the iMac line, 128 GB ($2600). Unlike on most other Macs,
RAM is user-accessible through a panel on the back, so you’d be smart to
buy RAM separately, where it will be far cheaper—perhaps as much as
two-thirds less.</p>

<h3 id="increased-ssd-storage">Increased SSD Storage</h3>

<p>Storage is locked at 256 GB for the low-end model, whereas the mid-range
model starts at 512 GB and lets you upgrade to 1 TB ($200) or 2 TB
($600). The high-end model also starts at 512 GB, offering the same 1
TB and 2 TB upgrades and adding 4 TB ($1200) and 8 TB ($2400) options.
The Fusion Drive is no longer an option for the 27-inch iMac.</p>

<h3 id="stronger-security-and-processing-with-the-t2-security-chip">Stronger Security and Processing with the T2 Security Chip</h3>

<p>New to the 27-inch iMac is Apple’s T2 security chip. Along with
encrypting all data on the SSD and ensuring that macOS hasn’t been
tampered with at boot, the T2 chip includes custom processors that
provide computational improvements for both audio and video. On the
downside, the T2 chip’s added security makes certain kinds of
troubleshooting and hardware repair difficult or impossible, so it’s
extra important to have reliable backups.</p>

<h3 id="improved-glare-and-ambient-light-handling">Improved Glare and Ambient Light Handling</h3>

<p>For those who have problems with screen glare, the 27-inch iMac now
offers a $500 option for “nano-texture glass,” which Apple says
provides “better viewing under various lighting conditions, such as a
bright room or indirect sunlight.” Previously, nano-texture glass was
available only for Apple’s Pro Display XDR screen. The iMac’s Retina
display also now supports True Tone, enabling it to adjust its color
temperature automatically for ambient light conditions.</p>

<h3 id="better-video-and-audio-for-videoconferencing">Better Video and Audio for Videoconferencing</h3>

<p>Those who spend their days on video calls will appreciate the new 1080p
FaceTime HD camera, a notable improvement on the previous 720p camera.
Apple also says the 27-inch iMac now features higher-fidelity speakers
and a studio-quality three-mic array for better audio output and input.</p>

<h3 id="faster-networking">Faster Networking</h3>

<p>Finally, if you need the ultimate networking performance, a $100 option
gets you 10 Gigabit Ethernet.</p>

<p>Overall, if you need a powerful desktop Mac with a gorgeous display, you
can’t go wrong with the new 27-inch iMac. It’s significantly cheaper
than the iMac Pro and more powerful than both the Mac mini and the
21.5-inch iMac. Just remember that some of the options are available
only if you start with the high-end configuration.</p>
