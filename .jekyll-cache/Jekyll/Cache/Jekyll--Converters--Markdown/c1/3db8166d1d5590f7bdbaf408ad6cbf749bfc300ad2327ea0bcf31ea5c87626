<p>The Apple Watch has a lot to offer older people, including heart rate
monitoring, atrial fibrillation detection, fall detection, and
electrocardiogram recording. But if you areâ€”or are helping someone who
isâ€”of the generation where watches once did nothing beyond telling the
time, too many options can be overwhelming. Adding to the confusion is
how easy it is to create and accidentally swipe between multiple watch
faces, making it so the Apple Watch suddenly looks and works completely
differently. If thatâ€™s an issue, use the Watch app to delete all but the
preferred watch face. In Watch &gt; My Watch, tap Edit to the right of My
Faces âžŠ, tap the red delete button next to a face âž‹, and then tap Remove
âžŒ.</p>
