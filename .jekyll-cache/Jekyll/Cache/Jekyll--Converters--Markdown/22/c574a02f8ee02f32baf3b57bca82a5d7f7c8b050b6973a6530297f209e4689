I"‚<p>The holiday shopping season is fast approaching! Given the significant
stresses placed on societyâ€™s fulfillment, distribution, and delivery
systems by the pandemic, we recommend you start thinking about your
holiday gift-giving sooner rather than later. Even Apple, which
generally does an excellent job predicting demand and shipping products
quickly, has been suffering from delays this year. But if you order in
time, Apple has a wide variety of products that would make great gifts
for your Apple-using loved ones.â€‹</p>

<p><strong>AirPods and AirPods Pro</strong></p>

<p>Apple makes two models of its insanely popular wireless earbuds: the
original <a href="https://www.apple.com/airpods/">AirPods</a> and the
noise-canceling <a href="https://www.apple.com/airpods-pro/">AirPods
Pro</a>. Although itâ€™s tempting
to assume that the AirPods Pro are simply better than the AirPods, the
decision isnâ€™t that simple. The AirPods are cheaper ($159, or $199
with a wireless charging case) and donâ€™t block the ear canal. The
AirPods Pro are smaller and cost $249, and you also get active noise
cancellation, a customizable fit, a wireless charging case, and sweat
and water resistance. However, the AirPods Pro block the ear canal,
which many people dislike, and donâ€™t stay in as well for some.</p>

<p><strong>HomePod and HomePod mini</strong></p>

<p>Appleâ€™s HomePod smart speaker lags behind Amazonâ€™s Alexa and Google Home
devices in large part because of its price, which started at $349 and
later dropped to $299. But the sound that the HomePod puts out is
top-notch, and Apple has done a good job of integrating the HomePod into
the overall ecosystem of Apple devices, so you can use it as a speaker
for an Apple TV. It also works well for controlling HomeKit-compatible
lights and plugs.</p>

<p>Cognizant of the price problem, Apple has just introduced a new HomePod
mini that enters the market at $99. Itâ€™s also a lot smaller than the
original HomePod, and while its sound probably isnâ€™t as good due to
fewer bits of audio hardware, weâ€™re betting that itâ€™s still excellent. A
HomePod mini can do nearly anything a HomePod can do, including creating
a stereo pair with another HomePod mini (but not with a HomePod). Itâ€™s a
cheaper introduction to having a Siri-enabled smart speaker and a nice
way to bring audio into other parts of a home or office.</p>

<p><strong>iPad</strong></p>

<p>Appleâ€™s iPad line is stronger than ever. At the top, the <a href="https://www.apple.com/ipad-pro/">iPad
Pro</a> comes in 11-inch and
12.9-inch models, and while theyâ€™re bursting with power, theyâ€™re also on
the high end of the price spectrum (starting at $799 and $999), which
makes them less attractive as gifts. Plus, they might be due for updates
soon.</p>

<p>Instead, for a demanding iPad user, look at the new fourth-generation
<a href="https://www.apple.com/ipad-air/">iPad Air</a> ($699), which
combines the flat-edged industrial design of the iPad Pro with Appleâ€™s
latest chip. Itâ€™s compatible with the second-generation <a href="https://www.apple.com/apple-pencil/">Apple
Pencil</a> ($129) and the
<a href="https://www.apple.com/ipad-keyboards/">Magic Keyboard for iPad</a>
($299).</p>

<p>For kids or those who want an iPad for simplerÂ purposes like browsing
the Web, reading books, watching TV, and playing casual games, you wonâ€™t
go wrong with the new eighth-generation
<a href="https://www.apple.com/ipad-10.2/">iPad</a>, which combines
thoroughly respectable specs with a low price starting at $329. For
additional input options, it works with the first-generation <a href="https://www.apple.com/apple-pencil/">Apple
Pencil</a> ($99) and the
<a href="https://www.apple.com/ipad-keyboards/">Smart Keyboard</a> ($159).</p>

<p>Finally, donâ€™t count the fifth-generation <a href="https://www.apple.com/ipad-mini/">iPad
mini</a> out. At $399, itâ€™s a
little more expensive than the 10.2-inch iPad, but its 7.9-inch screen
makes it a lot smaller, which many people like. It too is compatible
with the first-generation Apple Pencil, and although Apple doesnâ€™t make
any keyboards for it, it will work with any Bluetooth keyboard. If
youâ€™re having trouble deciding between the iPad and the iPad mini, check

<p><strong>Apple Watch gift certificate</strong></p>

<p>Finally, we love the <a href="https://www.apple.com/watch/">Apple Watch</a>,
and it would seem to make a great gift. However, we urge caution when
considering it as a present. The problem is Apple provides a dizzying
number of options, and everyone has their own preferences, so itâ€™s
difficult to know what to get. You can choose from the new <a href="https://www.apple.com/apple-watch-series-6/">Apple Watch
Series 6</a> (starting
at $399), the equally new but less expensive <a href="https://www.apple.com/apple-watch-se/">Apple Watch
SE</a> (starting at $279), or
the older <a href="https://www.apple.com/apple-watch-series-3/">Apple Watch Series
3</a> (starting at
$199). Get the Series 6 if you want an Always-On Display, blood oxygen
sensor, and ECG capabilities. The Apple Watch SE lacks those three
options but has the same screen size as the Series 6, along with its
compass, altimeter, and fall detection feature. And the Series 3 has a
slightly smaller screen and just the core Apple Watch features. Apple
has <a href="https://www.apple.com/watch/compare/">a helpful comparison
tool</a>.</p>

<p><img alt="Blog Photo" src="https://grovetech.co/assets/img/blog/2020/20201103Th/Apple-Watch-choices.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded m-2" width="700" /></p>

<p>Within each model, you have to choose between larger and smaller case
sizes, pick a case material (aluminum for all, or stainless steel or
titanium for the Series 6), a case color, a band type, and a band color.
And then thereâ€™s the question of whether Wi-Fiâ€“only is sufficient or if
a cellular-capable model makes more sense.</p>

<p>So unless you think you know exactly what the recipient would like, weâ€™d
encourage giving a certificate thatâ€™s good for a conversation about what
would be most appreciated. Then sit down with the <a href="https://www.apple.com/shop/studio">Apple Watch
Studio</a> to run through all the
aesthetic decisions.</p>
