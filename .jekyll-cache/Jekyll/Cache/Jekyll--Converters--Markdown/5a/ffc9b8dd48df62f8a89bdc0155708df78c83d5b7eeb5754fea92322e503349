I"©<p>Whenever you view a document thatâ€™s longer than will fit onscreen, a
scroll bar appears (often only if youâ€™re actively scrolling). Thatâ€™s
true whether youâ€™re using an iPhone, iPad, or Mac. Inside the scroll bar
is a control called a <em>scroller</em> that you can drag to scroll more
quickly than by swiping or using keyboard keys. But did you know its
size and position are useful for orienting yourself within the page?
First, the scroller position within the scroll bar reflects how far down
the page you are. Second, the size of the scroller indicates what
percentage of the page appears onscreen. When you see a large scroller,
most of the page is showing. With a small scroller, what you see is only
a portion of a longer page. Combine the size and position of the
scroller, and you can tell at a glance where in a page you are, and how
much is left to read.</p>
