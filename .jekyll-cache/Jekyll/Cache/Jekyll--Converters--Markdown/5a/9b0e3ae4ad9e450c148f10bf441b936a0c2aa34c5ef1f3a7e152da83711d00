<p>Along with a new version of Safari in iOS 15 and iPadOS 15, Apple has
released Safari 15 for macOS 11 Big Sur and macOS 10.15 Catalina. Why do
this before macOS 12 Monterey ships? Some of the browser‚Äôs new
capabilities‚Äînotably the Tab Groups feature‚Äîintegrate it more deeply
into your Apple device experience by syncing across devices. So,
assuming you have Safari 15 on at least some of your devices, what‚Äôs
new, and is it any good?</p>

<h3 id="new-tab-bar-interface">New Tab Bar Interface</h3>

<p>For Safari 15, Apple tried to minimize the tab bar interface to occupy
less screen real estate and stand out less from the content of Web pages
by co-opting the color of each page. Early betas were met with a litany
of complaints from testers, and Apple pulled back in the eventual
releases, offering settings that let you retain the old interface. How
that plays out varies between the iPhone, iPad, and Mac:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>iPhone:</strong> Apple combined the address bar and tab bar into a single
set of controls at the bottom of the screen, where they‚Äôre easier to
reach with your thumb while working one-handed and where you can
swipe left and right to switch tabs. Plus, the status bar area at
the top of the screen takes on the color from the current site,
which isn‚Äôt necessarily a visual win. This is a huge change from the
controls appearing at the top, so if you don‚Äôt like it, go to
Settings &gt; Safari and switch from Tab Bar (below left) to Single Tab
(below right). Turn off Allow Website Tinting (also below right) if
you don‚Äôt like the colorizing.

  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>iPad:</strong> Displays on the iPad are relatively small, so saving some
vertical space with the new Compact Tab Bar could be helpful.
However, since the tab bar automatically minimizes when you scroll
down a page, reducing its size when it‚Äôs visible isn‚Äôt as much of a
win as it might seem. And the colorized tab bar can be shockingly
bright. In Settings &gt; Safari, you can choose between Compact Tab Bar
(below top) and Separate Tab Bar (below bottom); either way,
consider disabling Show Color in Tab Bar.

  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Mac:</strong> Laptop screens aren‚Äôt huge, and Safari doesn‚Äôt minimize its
tab bar when you scroll, as it does on the iPhone and iPad, so
saving some vertical space might be welcome on a smaller screen. But
the way the Compact layout embeds the address field inside a tab and
reduces the number of buttons you can see may perturb you (below
top). Once again, the colorized tab bar can be glaring. To revert to
something closer to the old look, in Safari &gt; Preferences &gt; Tabs,
select Separate for the tab layout (below bottom), and disable Show
Color in Tab Bar to keep the controls gray regardless of the site
color.

  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="voice-search">Voice Search</h3>

<p>For many searches, it‚Äôs easier to speak than type, and Apple has made
doing that even faster with Voice Search on the iPhone and iPad. Tap the
current tab to display the address field, tap the microphone button, and
speak instead of typing. As soon as you stop, Safari performs the
search. You can even navigate directly to a site by speaking its URL,
like ‚Äúapple dot com.‚Äù Sadly, Apple didn‚Äôt extend this feature to the Mac
version of Safari 15.</p>

<h3 id="tab-switcher">Tab Switcher</h3>

<p>In iOS 14 and earlier, Safari used a card stack metaphor for its tab
switcher (below left), which could make it hard to see what each tab
contained. In Safari in iOS 15, Apple took a cue from the iPad and Mac
versions of the app and moved to a grid interface for the tab switcher
(below right). You can drag the tab thumbnails around to organize them
and remove them by tapping an X button (weirdly located in the
upper-right corner) or swiping them left off-screen. You can also bring
up the option to close all open tabs by pressing and holding Done at the
lower right corner of the screen.</p>

<h3 id="tab-groups">Tab Groups</h3>

<p>If you struggle under the cognitive load of dozens of unrelated tabs,
the new Tab Groups feature might help. With it, you can collect tabs
into as many groups as you like and switch among them. You work with tab
groups in either the tab switcher interface (iPhone and iPad with the
Separate Tab Bar) or the sidebar (Mac and iPad with the Compact Tab
Bar).</p>

<p>To open the tab switcher on the iPhone, tap the tab button in the lower-right corner of the
screen; on the iPad, tap the different-looking tab button in the upper-right corner. Once
you have the tab switcher open, tap X Tabs to reveal the Tab Groups
menu. To show the sidebar on either the iPad or the Mac, tap or click
the sidebar button in the upper-left corner of the
tab bar.</p>

<p>Once you have the Tab Groups menu or sidebar showing:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>To create a new tab group on the iPhone‚Äôs or iPad‚Äôs Tab Groups menu,
tap New Empty Tab Group, name it, and tap Save. In the sidebar on a
Mac or iPad, use the New Tab Group button at the top (or choose File &gt;
New Empty Tab Group on the Mac). You can also use New Tab Group from
X Tabs to create a tab group from currently open tabs.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To switch to a different tab group, tap it in the Tab Groups menu on
an iPhone or iPad, or access it from the sidebar on a Mac or iPad.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To delete a tab group, swipe left on it in the Tab Groups menu or
sidebar to reveal a delete icon on an iPhone or iPad; on the Mac,
Control-click it and choose Delete.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="shared-with-you">Shared with You</h3>

<p>Ever gone spelunking through Messages to find a link someone sent you?
Safari 15‚Äôs new Shared with You feature should help. It automatically
collects all Web pages you receive in Messages into a new Shared with
You section of the Safari start page. On the iPad and Mac, there‚Äôs also
a Shared with You item in the sidebar.</p>

<p><img alt="Blog Photo" src="https://grovetech.co/assets/img/blog/2021/20211001Sa/image12.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded m-2" width="400" /></p>

<h3 id="customizable-start-page">Customizable Start Page</h3>

<p>Speaking of the start page, if you want to customize which headings
appear and in what order, you can now do that on the iPhone and iPad.
(Choosing which headings appear has long been possible on the Mac by
clicking the little settings button in the lower-right corner, but
reordering isn‚Äôt possible there.)</p>

<p>Create a new tab to view the start page, scroll to the bottom, and tap
Edit. Then disable any headings you don‚Äôt want to see and drag the
remaining ones into your desired order. You can also choose among
several Apple-provided background images and have your start page
settings sync to your other devices.</p>

<h3 id="other-stuff">Other Stuff</h3>

<p>Two final new features may be welcome but probably won‚Äôt rock your
world:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Pull to refresh:</strong> If you need to reload a Web page on the iPhone
or iPad, either you can tap the reload button in the address field
if it‚Äôs visible with your tab bar settings, or you can now just pull
down with your finger from the top of a page.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>HTTPS upgrade:</strong> If you visit a website that supports encrypted
HTTPS but is also loading insecure content over unencrypted HTTP,
Safari will now ensure that you connect to it over HTTPS so your
entire connection is secure.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>There you have it! Check out the new features in Safari 15 and let them
improve your browsing experience.</p>
