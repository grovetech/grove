I"Å<p>If you‚Äôve filled up your external hard drives or become frustrated by
their limitations, it‚Äôs time to look into a network-attached storage
(NAS) device. What‚Äôs a NAS? It‚Äôs an intelligent storage device that can
accept one or more hard drives or SSDs and connects to your network via
Ethernet.</p>

<h3 id="nas-benefits">NAS Benefits</h3>

<p>A NAS is a good choice for anyone who needs access to lots of storage,
but small businesses in particular will appreciate the benefits of a
NAS. They include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>More storage:</strong> Most NAS devices provide multiple drive bays, so
you can pop in a few large hard drives or even attach expansion
units for a vast amount of available storage.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Expandable storage:</strong> A NAS is perfect if you anticipate your
storage needs growing over time. You could start with 3 TB drives
today and swap them out for 6 TB drives in a year or two.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Data protection:</strong> Drives fail, but some NAS devices can ensure
that you don‚Äôt lose data if that happens by combining multiple
drives into RAID arrays.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Network backups:</strong> Because a NAS is always available on your
network and provides lots of storage, it can work well for on-site
backups.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Laptop access:</strong> It‚Äôs fussy for mobile users to attach external
hard drives to laptop Macs. An always-available NAS eliminates that
annoyance.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Remote access and cloud storage:</strong> You can usually configure your
NAS so it‚Äôs available over the Internet from outside your network.
That means it can work like a private version of Dropbox that‚Äôs
entirely within your control and has no monthly fees.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Streaming media:</strong> Home users with massive movie libraries can
take advantage of NAS features that make it easy to stream video to
computers, TVs, tablets, and smartphones.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="nas-features">NAS Features</h3>

<p>Quite a few manufacturers make NAS devices, including
<a href="https://www.synology.com/" rel="nofollow">Synology</a>,
<a href="https://www.qnap.com/" rel="nofollow">QNAP</a>,
<a href="https://www.drobo.com/" rel="nofollow">Drobo</a>, and
<a href="https://www.wd.com/products/network-attached-storage.html" rel="nofollow">WD</a>,
and prices vary widely depending on the feature set. Things to consider
include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Number of drive bays:</strong> The most important decision to make when
choosing a NAS is the number of drive bays. It may be tempting to
start with a less-expensive two-bay model, but particularly if you
want to use RAID to protect your data, that limits your storage
significantly.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>RAID support:</strong> RAID works well for preventing data loss if a
drive dies. RAID 1 constantly mirrors the data from one drive to
another so if one fails, all the data is on the other. RAID 5 uses
data striping techniques with at least three drives to preserve data
even if one drive fails. Proprietary technologies may be more
flexible in terms of the number and size of the required drives.
<a href="https://www.synology.com/en-us/support/RAID_calculator" rel="nofollow">Synology‚Äôs RAID
Calculator</a>
is helpful for figuring out how much space you get with different
collections of drives.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Ethernet speed and ports:</strong> Most NAS devices have Gigabit
Ethernet, but you can pay more to get 10 Gigabit Ethernet. That‚Äôs
helpful only if you have an iMac Pro or a Thunderbolt 3 adapter.
Also, some NAS devices have a feature called link aggregation that
uses multiple Ethernet ports and an LACP-enabled Ethernet switch to
balance traffic across ports for higher performance in multi-user
setups.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Hardware encryption:</strong> For additional security, some NAS devices
offer hardware encryption. It requires more CPU power but ensures
that a stolen NAS won‚Äôt reveal your data.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Hardware transcoding:</strong> Those who host media libraries on a NAS
may find this feature useful. It automatically converts
high-resolution video files to versions that are optimized for the
destination‚Äîthere‚Äôs no reason to send 4K video to a 1080p TV.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>CPU and RAM:</strong> Since a NAS is a full-fledged computer, it has a
CPU and needs RAM to accomplish its tasks. If all you‚Äôre doing is
serving files, the CPU doesn‚Äôt matter much, but for hardware
encryption and transcoding, a faster CPU will be helpful. Similarly,
those functions, or support for lots of users, may benefit from more
RAM, so look for a NAS whose RAM is expandable.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Physical factors:</strong> Since a NAS runs all the time, pay attention
to how much power it draws and how much noise it makes. In general,
the less of each, the better.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="use-nas-specific-drives">Use NAS-specific Drives</h3>

<p>One final piece of advice. It‚Äôs tempting to use old drives you have
around, but doing so may be problematic for a few reasons:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Combining drives of different capacities can result in unusable disk
space in some RAID configurations.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The likelihood of failure is higher with older drives, and even if a
RAID prevents data loss, dealing with a dead drive is still
stressful.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>NAS-specific drives, as opposed to garden-variety drives, sport
features designed to minimize data corruption, minimize vibration,
and adjust rotation speeds for longer life.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Instead, look for NAS-specific drives, such as those in the <a href="https://www.wd.com/products/internal-storage/wd-red.html" rel="nofollow">WD
Red</a>
and <a href="https://www.seagate.com/internal-hard-drives/hdd/ironwolf/" rel="nofollow">Seagate

lines.</p>

<p>Honestly, while a NAS is a great investment and effective addition to
your technical infrastructure, picking the right one is a complex
decision. If you need help, get in touch with us to see what we
