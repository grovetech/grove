I"Æ<p>If you have access to multiple printers, you probably know that you can
choose one from the Printer pop-up menu at the top of the Print dialog.
But macOS has a feature that should make it so you donâ€™t have to switch
printers manually as often. Open System Preferences &gt; Printers &amp;
Scanners, and look at the bottom of the Print view. The Default Printer
pop-up menu lists all your installed printers, plus an option for Last
Printer Used. That last one makes sense if you print a number of
documents to the big office Canon, switch to printing images on the
Epson photo printer for a while, and then switch back again. But if you
primarily print to one printer, choose it from the Default Printer
pop-up menu. You can still switch to another printer in the Print dialog
anytime you want, but your main printer will always be the default.</p>
