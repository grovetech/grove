I"™<p>We love the Do Not Disturb feature in iOSâ€”itâ€™s essential for keeping
notifications from waking us up at night or causing embarrassing light
and noise in dark movie theater. But itâ€™s long had a problem. When you
invoked Do Not Disturb manually for a movie or doctorâ€™s appointment, you
had to remember to turn it off manually when you were done, or risk
missing important notifications. No more!</p>
