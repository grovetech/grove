I"]<p>We all have things we do regularly on our iPhones, whether it‚Äôs checking
the weather, searching Google, or invoking the magnifier. Apple has long
provided ways of making your most common actions easier to access. You
might put an app on your Dock, open Control Center, or take advantage of
the triple-press Accessibility shortcut. With iOS 14, Apple has opened
up a new and customizable way of triggering actions: Back
Tap.</p>

<p>With a double or triple tap on the back of any iPhone 8 or newer running
iOS 14, you can invoke any one of a variety of actions, including custom
Shortcuts. Sorry, Back Tap isn‚Äôt available in iPadOS 14.</p>

<p>Enabling Back Tap is easy, although you might not stumble upon it on
your own. That‚Äôs because it‚Äôs technically an accessibility feature for
those who have trouble interacting with the iPhone physically. But just
as curb cuts help both those in wheelchairs and stroller-pushing
parents, the Back Tap feature is a boon for everyone.</p>

<p>Go to Settings &gt; Accessibility &gt; Touch &gt; Back Tap (it‚Äôs way down at
the bottom), where you can attach actions to both double tap and a
triple tap.</p>

<p>Apple provides a broad set of actions, but most of them are focused on
helping people who can‚Äôt use other iPhone gestures. So yes, you could
make a double tap open Spotlight for searching, but unless that‚Äôs
somehow a lot easier than swiping down on the Home screen, it‚Äôs not
worth one of your two triggers. Actions fall into four categories:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>System:</strong> Most of the System choices mimic
easy Home screen gestures or button presses. Most interesting are
Mute, which toggles the ringer volume without forcing you to press
the Volume Down button repeatedly, and Screenshot, which takes a
picture of your screen without making you press two buttons at once.</li>
  <li><strong>Accessibility:</strong> For those who need these
Accessibility options, having them easily accessible via Back Tap
will be welcome. The most compelling actions for the general public
are Magnifier, Speak Screen, and Voice Control. (Voice Control
provides much more capable dictation than Siri.)</li>
  <li><strong>Scroll Gestures:</strong> These options scroll a
vertically oriented page or screen. Sadly, they don‚Äôt work for
horizontally driven page flipping in book reading apps like Libby.</li>
  <li><strong>Shortcuts:</strong> Here‚Äôs where Back Tap becomes
ultimately useful, at least if you can find or build the necessary
shortcuts. Anything Shortcuts can do, you can invoke with a double
or triple tap.</li>
</ul>

<p>Wait, what‚Äôs Shortcuts? It‚Äôs an automation app that Apple includes with
every iPhone. With it, you can chain together multiple actions derived
from iOS capabilities or provided by your apps to create custom
<em>shortcuts</em>. Other systems call similar collections of commands <em>macros</em>
or <em>automations</em> or <em>workflows.</em></p>

<p>Explaining how to build your own shortcuts is a topic for another day,
but you can also download sample shortcuts from Apple‚Äôs gallery, both to
see how it‚Äôs done and to use them. For instance, if you tap the Gallery
button in Shortcuts ‚ûä, tap Starter Shortcuts ‚ûã, tap Take a Break ‚ûå, and
tap Add Shortcut ‚ûç, you‚Äôll copy the Take a Break shortcut to My
Shortcuts. Then you can assign a double tap in Back Tap to invoke Take a
Break, which sets an alarm for a specified number of minutes and turns
on Do Not Disturb until the alarm goes off.</p>

<p>Give it a try! Back Tap might turn out to be the iOS 14 feature you use
more frequently than any other.</p>
