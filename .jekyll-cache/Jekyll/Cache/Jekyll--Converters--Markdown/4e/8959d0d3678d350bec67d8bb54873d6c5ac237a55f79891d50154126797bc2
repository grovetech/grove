I"˜<p>With the iPhone 11, iPhone 11 Pro, and iPhone 11 Pro Max, Apple changed
the way the Camera appâ€™s shutter button works in ways that could cause
confusion. Tapping it once still takes a single still photo, but if you
press and hold on the shutter button, it now captures a quick video.
(Previously, pressing and holding on the button took photos in burst
mode; to do that on the iPhone 11 models, slide the shutter button to
the left.) Once youâ€™ve started taking a quick video, slide your finger
to the right to lock recording, so you donâ€™t have to keep holding the
button down. Tap the white shutter button to take a still image while
recording; tap the red record button to stop recording. For even easier
quick video recording, press and hold either of the volume buttons; a
single press still takes a photo. Note that quick videos always record
with mono sound and at a resolution of 1920-by-1440; for stereo sound
and the resolution set in Settings &gt; Camera, use the Camera appâ€™s Video
mode.</p>
