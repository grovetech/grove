I"‹<p>Your websites and your systems are only as good as the backup strategy that you have for them. While managing Macâ€™s you may think that having a strategy for website data backup is not relevant or important. Until you realize all of the technologies that you use on a daily basis that are actually moving to the web platform or cloud. For example OSX Wiki Server and Profile Manager 2 are all 100% web based technologies. If you use a web based ticketing system like Web Help Desk or Spiceworks again you need a strategy. Hitting more to home if you use Munki with MunkiWebAdmin or Casper then you need some kind of web based backup strategy.</p>
