I"ø<p>We called it earlier this week saying Apple is likely to move Macs to
their own ARM based processors, Well Apple have announced Macs will be
available with â€˜Apple Siliconâ€™ from late 2020.</p>

<p>So, what does it mean for you if you have just bought a Summer 2020
Mac? Very little in all fairness as we discussed in the article earlier
this week Intel Macs will still be relevant for most of the 2020â€™s the
final death nail will probably be App developers no longer supporting
Intel processors much like the transition from PowerPC to Intel back in
2006.</p>

<p>At the WWDC Apple made all the Mac presentations on their own ARM
processors which Apple are calling â€˜Apple Siliconâ€™. In these
presentations we saw the new ARM based chips running Linux and Windows
10 in Virtual Machines.</p>

<p>Indeed, the Microsoft Surface Pro X runs on an ARM based processor
already so we know Windows already supports ARM processors so boot
camping or running Windows in a VM will still be possible.</p>

<p>Apple has announced Rosetta 2 which will allow Intel Apps to run on the
new Apple Silicon for several years to come. We donâ€™t expect the last
Intel Mac to ship until sometime in 2022 if not later depending on how
the Apple Silicon &amp; Intel chips progress in the next 2
years.</p>

<p>Already if you are a registered Apple Developer you can apply to
purchase a Mac Mini with Apple Silicon , for everyone else expect an
announcement from Apple this fall with a Mac line up running on Appleâ€™s
new ARM processors.</p>
