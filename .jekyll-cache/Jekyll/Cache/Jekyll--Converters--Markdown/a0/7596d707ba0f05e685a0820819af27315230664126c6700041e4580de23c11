<hr />
<p>The Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) of the U.S.  Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) defines telehealth as:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The use of electronic information and telecommunications  technologies to support and promote long-distance clinical  health care, patient and professional health-related  education, and public health and health administration. Technologies include videoconferencing, the internet, store-  and-forward imaging, streaming media, and landline and  wireless communications.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The Office for Civil Rights (OCR)  has made it easier for all  covered healthcare providers to  participate in telehealth during  the COVID-19 nationwide public  health emergency. Their  notification states:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The Office for Civil Rights  will not impose penalties for  noncompliance with HIPAA  Rules in connection with the  good faith provision of  telehealth using such non-  public facing audio or video  communication products.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>IMPORTANT: Penalties will only  not be imposed for telehealth  related items. Penalties for non-  compliance with other sections  of the HIPAA regulations will  still apply!</p>
