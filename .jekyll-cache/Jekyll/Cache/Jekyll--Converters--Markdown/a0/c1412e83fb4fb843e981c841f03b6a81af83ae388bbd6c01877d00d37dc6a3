I"@<p>Traditionally, extended keyboards come with a Forward Delete key that,
when you press it, deletes characters to the <em>right</em> of the insertion
point, unlike the main Delete key, which deletes to the <em>left</em> of the
insertion point. Forward Delete still exists on Apple’s Magic Keyboard
with Numeric Keypad, but it’s missing from the Magic Keyboard and all
Mac laptop keyboards. If you like using Forward Delete (and well you
should!), the secret key combinations that simulate it for any Apple
keyboard that lacks it are Fn-Delete and Control-D. You can often add
Option to the mix to delete the word to the right of the insertion point
instead of just a character.</p>
