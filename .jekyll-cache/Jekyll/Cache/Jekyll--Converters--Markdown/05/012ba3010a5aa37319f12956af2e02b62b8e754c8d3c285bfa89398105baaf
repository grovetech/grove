I"º<p>Are you overwhelmed by email? Is your Inbox filled with promotions,
special offers, and the like? These messages arenâ€™t spamâ€”you almost
always bought something from the company or have some sort of
relationship with the senderâ€”but that doesnâ€™t mean you want to hear
from them repeatedly. Luckily, itâ€™s easy to get off the lists of
legitimate senders. Just scroll to the bottom of each message and look
for an unsubscribe link. Often it will be the word â€œUnsubscribeâ€ or an
instruction to â€œclick here to remove yourself.â€ Click the link and, if
necessary, click an Unsubscribe button on the resulting Web page. Then
delete the message and move on to the next one. After a week or so of
doing this regularly, you should start to notice a marked decrease in
unwanted messages.</p>
