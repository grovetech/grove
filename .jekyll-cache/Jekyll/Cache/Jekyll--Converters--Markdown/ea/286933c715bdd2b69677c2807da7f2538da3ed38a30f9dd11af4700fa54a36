<p>Here’s a tricky situation that threw one of our clients for a loop
recently. Texts they sent in Messages via iMessage (indicated by blue
bubbles) to their son, letting him know they were stopping by weren’t
being delivered, making their visits a surprise. But other texts worked
fine. The problem, it turned out, was that Cellular Data had somehow
gotten turned off in Settings &gt; Cellular. So messages worked fine as
long as the iPhone was on Wi-Fi at home, but as soon as they were on the
road using a cellular connection, the iPhone could no longer communicate
with the Internet. In theory, Messages should fall back to SMS
(indicated by green bubbles), which doesn’t require cellular data, but
that doesn’t always happen. The fix? Just enable Settings &gt; Cellular &gt;
Cellular Data again.</p>
