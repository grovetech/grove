<p>For the longest time, in order to sign a document that you had received via email such as a PDF file, you would have to print out the file first, sign it on the dotted line using a pen, scan the docu-ment and send it to yourself using a USB flash or email, and then finally send it to your recipient. A rather long process, isnâ€™t it?</p>

<p>Apple made this tedious process easier with its built-in Preview available on all Macs that have OS X Lion or later installed. You can electronically sign your PDF and save time and effort. This is especially helpful if you have multiple documents that you need to sign.</p>

<p>First open the PDF file that you want to sign in Preview.</p>

<p>Click on the <img src="https://grovetech.co/assets/img/blog/2017/pdf/toolbox.png" width="32" />  toolbox icon and <img src="https://grovetech.co/assets/img/blog/2017/pdf/signature.png" width="32" />  signature icon.</p>

<p>Next, click on the Create Signature &gt; Click Here to Begin. You can draw your signature on the trackpad. When you are finished, click on any key and then Done.</p>

<p>If you are using the trackpad to create your signature for the first time, go slow and steady using your finger for best results. For a fine-tipped end, consider using a stylus or Apple Pencil for a precise signature.</p>

<p>If you already have an electronic signature saved, you can choose to insert that instead as well.</p>

<p>Preview makes it easy for you create and save multiple electronic signatures even if you do not have a PDF document open yet. This is very helpful for future use with several PDF files without having to repeat steps.</p>

<p>Next, click on the signature youâ€™ve just created to insert it right into your PDF document. You can resize it and move it as you need just like you would with an image.</p>
