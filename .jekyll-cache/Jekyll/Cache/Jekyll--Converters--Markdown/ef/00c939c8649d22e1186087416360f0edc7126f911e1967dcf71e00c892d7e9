I"Ê<p>If you‚Äôve got a perfectly usable printer that only supports USB connections that is to say non-network or non-wireless printers it‚Äôs possible to share it on your network so other Macs can print to it.</p>

<p>To share your printer on a Mac or with a UNIX computer the computers must be on the same network as your Mac, Mac users must be running OS X Tiger or later.
Go to:</p>

<p>System Preferences &gt; Sharing</p>

<p>By default, if you share a printer, everyone on your network can use it.</p>

<p>To restrict printer sharing to specific users click the Add button <img src="https://grovetech.co/assets/img/blog/2018/printersharing/image10.png" width="20" /> which is at the bottom of the Users list:</p>

<p><img src="https://grovetech.co/assets/img/blog/2018/printersharing/image9.png" class="img-fluid rounded m-2" width="700" /></p>

<p>Choose a person from Users &amp; Groups, which is a list of all the current users of your Mac.</p>

<p><img src="https://grovetech.co/assets/img/blog/2018/printersharing/image2.png" class="img-fluid rounded m-2" width="700" /></p>

<p>You can also choose a user from Network Users / Network Groups, you will only have this option if you have set up Groups in the Users &amp; Groups preference pane.</p>

<p>Or you can choose a person from the contacts list, when you do this you will be asked to create a password for the contact and they will be added to the Users &amp; Groups preference pane, then click Create Account. When you add a contact to the Users list the ‚ÄúEveryone‚Äù access will be set to No Access meaning you will have to set up a user for each person you want to share the printer with.</p>

<p><img src="https://grovetech.co/assets/img/blog/2018/printersharing/image1.png" class="img-fluid rounded m-2" width="700" /></p>

<p>You can re-enable Everyone access to the printer users by clicking the No Access option and setting it back to Can Print:</p>

<p>To remove a User from the list click on the name to select and press the remove  <img src="https://grovetech.co/assets/img/blog/2018/printersharing/image3.png" width="20" /> button.</p>

<p><img src="https://grovetech.co/assets/img/blog/2018/printersharing/image5.png" class="img-fluid rounded m-2" width="700" /></p>

<p>You may not remove the ‚ÄúEveryone‚Äù User all you can do is set the ‚ÄúEveryone‚Äù User to No Access.</p>
