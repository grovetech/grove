I"4<p>You know you can make albums and smart albums in Photos, and do searches
to find photos that contain particular objects. But what if you want to
separate photos from videos, identify which images in an album have been
edited, or pick out just the ones you’ve favorited? For that, use
Photos’ filters. On the Mac (below left), click the Showing menu in the
upper-right corner, and in iOS and iPadOS (iPhone screens below right),
tap the ••• button in the upper-right corner and tap Filter. Either way,
you can choose Favorites, Edited, Photos, or Videos to limit the items
showing to that type. When you’re done, turn the filter off by choosing
All Items.</p>
