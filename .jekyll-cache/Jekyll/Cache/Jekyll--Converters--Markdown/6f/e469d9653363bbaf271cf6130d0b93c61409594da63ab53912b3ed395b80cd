I"ò<p>Sure, you could select a file in the Finder and choose File &gt; Move to
Trash or drag it to the Trash in the Dock. Similarly, you can trash
selected photos in Apple‚Äôs Photos app by choosing Image &gt; Delete <em>X</em>
Photos, or by pressing the Delete key, but both of those methods result
in a dialog asking if you‚Äôre sure. The easiest way of trashing a file in
the Finder or a picture in Photos is to select it and press
Command-Delete. Poof, it‚Äôs in the Trash (Finder) or Recently Deleted
album (Photos), with no extra effort or prompts! And if you accidentally
trash the wrong thing, just press Command-Z to restore it. Keep this key
combination in mind for other apps too, since they may also support it
as a shortcut for ‚Äúdelete without prompting.‚Äù</p>
