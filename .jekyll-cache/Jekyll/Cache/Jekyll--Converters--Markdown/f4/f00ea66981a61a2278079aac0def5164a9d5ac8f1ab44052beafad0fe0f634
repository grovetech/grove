I"á<p>Letting go of the ubiquitous Home button, a constant on the iPhone, iPad and iPod Touch since the first iPhone in 2007, is a bold change in the new iPhone X. Over time, this button has gained more functionality. However, in building the new iPhone X with an edge-to-edge OLED display, Apple has eliminated the Home button entirely. How do you use the iPhone X without the Home button? Here‚Äôs a quick introduction. You can view Apple‚Äôs intro video here.</p>

<p>Most gestures do not require a lot of precision and just being in the general area, will allow them to work.

Your first swipe will perform the command of the game, and the second swipe performs the iOS system command. Below are 12 frequently used touch gestures and commands of iPhone X that are handy to know right away.</p>
