I"¢<p>Before iOS 12, Apple Maps was the only mapping app you could run on the
dashboard in a CarPlay-equipped automobile. But Maps doesnâ€™t always work
well, and some people prefer directions from Google Maps or the
Google-owned Waze. Once you upgrade your iPhone to iOS 12 and update to
the latest version of Google Maps or Waze for iOS, youâ€™ll be able to use
those apps on your CarPlay screen. Happy navigating!</p>
