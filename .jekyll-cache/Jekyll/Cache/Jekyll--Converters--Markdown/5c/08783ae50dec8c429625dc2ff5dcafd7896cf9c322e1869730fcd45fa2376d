I"Ò<p>Have you ever seen the dreaded ‚ÄúNo Service‚Äù label at the top of your
iPhone‚Äôs screen, even when you‚Äôre pretty sure there should be cellular
reception? It‚Äôs not common, but the iPhone‚Äôs cellular radio can
occasionally get confused. Luckily, you can easily fix the problem. Open
Control Center (swipe down from the upper-right corner on an iPhone X or
later or an iPad; or up from the bottom on an earlier iPhone) and tap
the airplane icon to put the iPhone in airplane mode. That turns off the
cellular radio. Wait a few seconds and tap the airplane icon again to
re-enable the cellular radio. If that doesn‚Äôt work, power-cycle your
iPhone by holding the side or Sleep/Wake button until you see the Power
Off slider. Slide it to turn the iPhone off, then press and hold the
side or Sleep/Wake button again until the iPhone restarts.</p>
