I".<p>By default, Apple populates your Mac’s Dock with all sorts of apps and
arranges them in a particular order. But there’s no rhyme or reason to
the defaults, and you shouldn’t be afraid to add, remove, and rearrange
apps on your Dock. To add an app, drag its icon from the Applications
folder to the desired spot on the Dock. To remove an app you never use,
drag its icon far enough off the Dock that a Remove tag appears above
the icon and then let go. To arrange the Dock icons in the order that
makes the most sense to you, just drag each icon to your preferred
location. We generally like to put our most-used apps in the left-most
or top-most spots.</p>
