I"C<p>Apple’s prices for Lightning, USB-C, and Thunderbolt 3 cables often seem
high—$19 for a <a href="https://www.apple.com/shop/product/MQGJ2AM/A/usb-c-to-lightning-cable-1-m" rel="nofollow">USB-C to Lightning
cable</a>
or $29 if you want a <a href="https://www.apple.com/shop/product/MD819AM/A/lightning-to-usb-cable-2-m" rel="nofollow">2-meter
version</a>?
Unfortunately, when it comes to cables, you often get what you pay for.
Happily, other reputable hardware manufacturers like
<a href="https://www.anker.com/products/110/cables" rel="nofollow">Anker</a> and
<a href="https://www.belkin.com/us/c/WSSTCBLS" rel="nofollow">Belkin</a> make
quality cables and often charge less than Apple.</p>

<p>Stay away from the bargain basement prices from no-name Chinese
manufacturers, and if you see a supposedly genuine Apple cable selling
for a too-good-to-be-true price, consider the possibility that it’s
counterfeit. Apple has even created a detailed page that explains <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204566">how
to identify counterfeit or uncertified Lightning
accessories</a>.</p>

<p>The problem with cheap cables is not just that they might break or wear
out sooner, but that many modern cables carry power as well as data.
When there’s sufficient juice flowing down those tiny wires, a
short-circuit can fry hardware or in the worst cases, generate sparks,
smoke, or even fire. Don’t misunderstand—fires aren’t likely, but over
the years, there have been numerous <a href="https://www.goodmorningamerica.com/living/story/gma-investigates-inexpensive-lightning-cables-harm-phone-54920478" rel="nofollow">headlines about fires caused by
charging
iPhones</a>
and Android smartphones. In fact, <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/2019/05/29/target-recall-90000-usb-charging-cables-can-shock-catch-fire/1277867001/" rel="nofollow">Target just recalled 90,000
Lightning to USB
cables</a>
after 14 reports of the cables smoking, sparking, and igniting.</p>

<p>When it comes to damaging hardware, USB-C was a problem early on but is
less so now, thanks to the efforts of Google engineer Benson Leung in
2015 and 2016. After a bad USB-C cable fried his Chromebook, he embarked
on a one-man crusade to identify which USB-C cables were good and which
were bad. He has moved on from that now, but in part due to his efforts,
Amazon started prohibiting listings of USB-C cables and adapters that
weren’t compliant with the USB-C specs. You might still run across bad
cables that Amazon hasn’t yet identified, or dodgy cables sold through
other retailers, but the danger is lower than it used to be,
particularly with cables from name brands.</p>

<p>Lightning cables are incredibly common these days—you can buy them in
gas stations and drugstores—and as with USB-C cables, you’ll do best
if you stick with cables from brand name companies. You’ll pay more, but
do you really trust electronics sold next to Twinkies and Slim Jims? It
might be worth buying one in a pinch, but don’t rely on it.</p>

<p>Of course, even the best cables will fray and fail if you mistreat them.
Follow this advice to ensure a long life for even heavily used cables:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Don’t create sharp bends in the cable, especially near the
connector. Sharp bends can eventually break the insulation and
reveal the wires inside.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When unplugging your device, pull from the plug instead of further
down on the cord. That avoids stress near the connector.<br />

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When coiling your cables, avoid wrapping them tightly around
something that’s not round. A tight wrap can cause kinks that will
degrade the wires inside.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Don’t put heavy objects on cables, or sandwich them between a desk
and the wall. Anything that compresses the cable can cause damage.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>iPhones may be fairly water resistant these days, but try to keep
both the Lighting port and the cable’s pins clean and away from
liquids because crud or a droplet could cause a short circuit. USB-C
cables are less susceptible to such problems because of their metal
jackets, but it’s still worth being careful.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If a cable’s insulation ever breaks so you can see the wires inside,
wrap it with electrical tape right away, and replace it as soon as
you can.<br />

  </li>
</ul>

<p>In the end, the advice is pretty simple. Spend a little more on quality
products from reputable manufacturers so you don’t have to worry about
your $1000 iPhone XS being damaged by a $3 counterfeit Lightning
cable.</p>
