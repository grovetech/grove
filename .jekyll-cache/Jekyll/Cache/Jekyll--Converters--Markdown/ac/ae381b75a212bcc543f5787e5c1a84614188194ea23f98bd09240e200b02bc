I"≤/<p>At a special event at the Brooklyn Academy of Music, Apple threw back
the curtains on significant updates to the long-ignored MacBook Air and
even longer-ignored Mac mini. Then Tim Cook and company followed up with
revamped 11-inch and 12.9-inch iPad Pros, complete with an enhanced
Smart Keyboard Folio and redesigned Apple Pencil. You can order all of
Apple‚Äôs new gear right away, though demand may delay shipping for a week
or two on some items.</p>

<hr />

<p>When Steve Jobs introduced the MacBook Air in 2008 by pulling it out of
an envelope, it set the standard for the ultralight notebook category.
But Apple has focused on the high-end MacBook Pro line of late, making
this major revision extremely welcome.</p>

<h3 id="retina-display-and-touch-id">Retina Display and Touch ID</h3>
<hr />

<p>Most notably, the new <a href="https://www.apple.com/macbook-air/">MacBook
Air</a> features a
13.3-inch Retina display that‚Äôs far crisper than the previous model‚Äôs
screen. Although the screen is the same size as before, Apple eliminated
the aluminum bezel around it, taking the screen much closer to the edge.
That let the company reduce the MacBook Air‚Äôs size, making it almost an
inch (2.1 cm) less wide and more than half an inch (1.5 cm) less deep.
Even more important, Apple dropped the weight by almost a quarter pound
(100 g). It‚Äôs noticeably smaller and lighter now.</p>

<p><img src="https://grovetech.co/assets/img/blog/2018/applefinally/image2.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded m-2" width="750" /></p>

<p>The other major improvement in the MacBook Air is the addition of a
Touch ID sensor in the upper-right corner of the keyboard. Rather than
typing your password to log in, you can just place your finger on the
Touch ID sensor. It also works to unlock some apps like 1Password. To
support the Touch ID sensor, the MacBook Air includes Apple‚Äôs T2
security chip, which prevents the boot process from being tampered with,
encrypts all data on the SSD, and enables ‚ÄúHey Siri.‚Äù</p>

<h3 id="evolutionary-updates">Evolutionary Updates</h3>
<hr />

<p>Many of the remaining changes just bring the MacBook into the modern
age. It sports two Thunderbolt 3 ports on the left side for charging and
connecting peripherals, and a headphone jack on the right side‚Äîall the
previous ports are gone. The keyboard is the same one used in the most
recent update to the MacBook Pro, which isn‚Äôt universally loved‚Äîif
you‚Äôre particular about keyboards, give this one a try before buying.
Apple also replaced the old Multi-Touch trackpad with a larger Force
Touch trackpad that‚Äôs more responsive and provides additional
capabilities.</p>

<p><img src="https://grovetech.co/assets/img/blog/2018/applefinally/image3.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded m-2" width="750" /></p>

<p>By default, the MacBook Air comes with 8 GB of RAM and a 128 GB SSD. You
can jump to 16 GB for $200, and we generally recommend that. Similarly,
you can upgrade the storage to 256 GB for $200, 512 GB for $400, or
1.5 TB for $1200.</p>

<p>We haven‚Äôt mentioned performance yet. Apple says only that the MacBook
Air‚Äôs 1.6 GHz dual-core Intel Core i5 processor delivers ‚Äúthe
performance you need for everyday activities like organizing your
photos, browsing the Web, creating presentations or viewing and editing
videos.‚Äù Since Apple never misses the chance to say how much faster a
new Mac is than the model it replaces, we have to assume that the new
MacBook is no faster than the old one. Hopefully, benchmarks will appear
soon.</p>

<h3 id="price">Price</h3>
<hr />

<p>The new MacBook Air comes in silver, gold, and space gray, and pricing
starts at $1199 for 8 GB of RAM and 128 GB of storage. If performance
is important to you, however, you should consider the non-Touch Bar
13-inch MacBook Pro, which costs only $100 more and is just a bit
heavier. And if you‚Äôre willing to settle for older technology and a
larger form factor, note that the old MacBook Air remains for sale
starting at $999. Finally, the 12-inch MacBook also remains in the
lineup, but at $1299, it‚Äôs overpriced and underpowered, and thus
interesting only if you want the smallest possible Mac.</p>

<h2 id="mac-mini-goes-pro-with-massive-performance-boost">Mac mini Goes Pro with Massive Performance Boost</h2>
<hr />

<p>Apple updated the MacBook Air for consumers and students, but the
company is aiming the revamped <a href="https://www.apple.com/mac-mini/">Mac
mini</a> at professional
users. This update, the first in over 4 years, takes a cue from the
similarly pro-focused iMac Pro in changing the color from silver to
space gray, but otherwise it retains the same form factor‚Äî7.7 inches
(19.7 cm) square and 1.4 inches (3.6 cm) high.</p>

<p><img src="https://grovetech.co/assets/img/blog/2018/applefinally/image4.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded m-2" width="750" /></p>

<h3 id="speeds-and-feeds">Speeds and Feeds</h3>
<hr />

<p>What has changed are the guts of the Mac mini, which offer huge
performance gains over the previous version from 2014. Those
improvements come from eighth-generation Intel Core processors: a base
3.6 GHz 4-core i3, a mid-level 3.0 GHz 6-core i5, and a top-of-the-line
3.2 GHz 6-core i7. Apple claims up to five times the performance of the
previous Mac mini and up to 60% speedier graphics performance thanks to
the integrated Intel UHD Graphics 630.</p>

<p>You won‚Äôt lack for RAM or storage either. The Mac mini comes with 8 GB
of RAM, but you can upgrade to 16 GB ($200), 32 GB ($600), or 64 GB
($1400). Less expensive memory is available from other vendors. While
the Mac mini‚Äôs base 128 GB of SSD storage might be adequate if all your
data is stored on a NAS device, you can upgrade to 256 GB ($200), 512
GB ($400), 1 TB ($800), or 2 TB ($1600). That storage is
automatically encrypted thanks to the Mac mini‚Äôs T2 security chip, which
also speeds HEVC video transcoding.</p>

<p>While Apple‚Äôs notebooks have been shedding ports, the Mac mini has
bucked the trend. It features four Thunderbolt 3 ports, an HDMI 2.0
port, two USB-A ports, an audio jack, and a Gigabit Ethernet jack, with
10 Gigabit Ethernet as an option. Thanks to the Thunderbolt 3 and HDMI
ports, you can connect either a 5K display and a 4K display, or three 4K
displays.</p>

<p><img src="https://grovetech.co/assets/img/blog/2018/applefinally/image5.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded m-2" width="750" /></p>

<h3 id="price-1">Price</h3>
<hr />

<p>All this power comes at a price. The new Mac mini starts at $799 for
the 3.6 GHz 4-core Intel Core i3, 8 GB of RAM, and 128 GB of storage.
However, build-to-order options for a faster processor, more RAM, and
more storage could raise the price to a whopping $4199.</p>

<p>Nonetheless, the Mac mini is once again an attractive option for anyone
who already has a good display, keyboard, and mouse, none of which are
included. It‚Äôs also ideal for those who want to stuff a Mac into a tight
space, bring it on stage for a live performance, or stack a bunch of
them for rendering video.</p>

<h3 id="11-inch-and-129-inch-ipad-pro-boast-new-screens-and-redesigned-apple-pencil">11-inch and 12.9-inch iPad Pro Boast New Screens and Redesigned Apple Pencil</h3>
<hr />

<p>As welcome as the MacBook Air and Mac mini updates were, Apple really
knocked it out of the park with its new <a href="https://www.apple.com/ipad-pro/">iPad
Pro</a> models, which are the
most significant changes to the iPad line yet.</p>

<p><img src="https://grovetech.co/assets/img/blog/2018/applefinally/image6.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded m-2" width="750" /></p>

<h3 id="face-id-enables-physical-redesigns">Face ID Enables Physical Redesigns</h3>
<hr />

<p>Like the iPhone X series, these new iPad Pros drop Touch ID in favor of
Face ID authentication. The 7-megapixel TrueDepth camera on the front of
the iPad Pro that makes Face ID possible also enables support for
Portrait mode, Portrait Lighting, and Animoji and Memoji.</p>

<p>Losing the Home button enabled Apple to bring the display closer to the
edge of the iPad. With the 11-inch iPad Pro (the measurement is the
diagonal screen size), that means a larger display in roughly the same
form factor as the older 10.5-inch model (which remains for sale). And
with the 12.9-inch iPad, Apple kept the display size the same as before
but shrank the height of the case by almost an inch so it‚Äôs now the size
of an 8.5-by-11-inch piece of paper and a little lighter.</p>

<p>Apple also changed the industrial design slightly, reverting to the flat
edges last seen in the iPhone 5s. One of those edges sports a magnetic
attachment area and wireless charging spot for the redesigned Apple
Pencil.</p>

<p>Speaking of charging, Apple broke with tradition and dropped the
Lightning connector in favor of the industry-standard USB-C for charging
and connecting to peripherals. That will make it easier to connect to an
external display. You may also need a $9 <a href="https://www.apple.com/shop/product/MU7E2AM/A/usb-c-to-35-mm-headphone-jack-adapter">USB-C-to-3.5mm headphone
jack
adapter</a>.</p>

<h3 id="incremental-changes">Incremental Changes</h3>
<hr />

<p>Those are the most obvious new features, but some of the more
evolutionary changes will be equally as welcome. Most notable is the new
A12X Bionic chip with embedded M12 coprocessor and Neural Engine. This
Apple-designed chip is reportedly faster than 95% of laptops available
today, and it gives the iPad Pro unparalleled performance among iOS
devices.</p>

<p>That performance also powers the improved 12-megapixel rear camera,
giving it enhanced computational photography capabilities, like Smart
HDR, which takes multiple images and combines them intelligently for the
best possible exposure. On-screen performance is improved, and
everything will look better than ever before thanks to a new Liquid
Retina display that features Apple‚Äôs True Tone and ProMotion
technologies. In a classic Apple touch, the screen now features rounded
corners.</p>

<p><img src="https://grovetech.co/assets/img/blog/2018/applefinally/image7.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded m-2" width="750" /></p>

<h3 id="accessories">Accessories</h3>
<hr />

<p>Along with the revamped iPad Pro models, Apple introduced a new Smart
Keyboard Folio that improves on the previous Smart Keyboard by wrapping
around to protect the back of the iPad Pro as well. It uses a redesigned
Smart Connector and provides two viewing angles.</p>

<p><img src="https://grovetech.co/assets/img/blog/2018/applefinally/image8.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded m-2" width="750" /></p>

<p>More impressive is the new Apple Pencil, which now features a flat,
touch-sensitive surface that you can double-tap to change drawing modes
in many apps. That flat surface also makes it easy to attach to the edge
of the iPad Pro magnetically so you won‚Äôt lose it and where it charges
wirelessly. The easy-to-lose cap is gone, as is the Lightning connector,
so the Apple Pencil is now shorter and more pencil-like‚Äîit won‚Äôt roll
off the desk anymore.</p>

<h3 id="price-2">Price</h3>
<hr />

<p>How much will all this goodness cost? By the time all is said and done,
you‚Äôll be in MacBook Air range. The 11-inch iPad Pro starts at $799 for
a Wi-Fi-only model with 64 GB of storage. 256 GB runs $949, 512 GB is
$1149, and 1 TB will set you back $1549. Add $150 if you want
cellular connectivity in any of these configurations.</p>

<p>For the 12.9-inch iPad Pro, add $200, so $999 for 64 GB, $1149 for
$256 GB, $1349 for 512 GB, and $1749 for 1 TB. Cellular puts another
$150 on the tab. Both sizes of iPad are available in either silver or
space gray.</p>

<p>The new Apple Pencil costs $129, and the Smart Keyboard Folio is either
$179 for the 11-inch model or $199 for the 12.9-inch model.</p>

<p>Remember, you can still get a regular iPad for as little as $329 and
the original Apple Pencil is only $99, so if all you want is an iPad,
you don‚Äôt need to spring for an iPad Pro. But if you‚Äôre using an iPad
Pro as your primary work device and are willing to pay for the power,
these new models are compelling upgrades.</p>
