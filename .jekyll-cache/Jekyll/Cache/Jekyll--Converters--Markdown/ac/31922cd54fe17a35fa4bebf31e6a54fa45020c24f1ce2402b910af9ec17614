I"‘	<p><strong>You Canâ€™t Teach an Old Dogâ€¦. or Can You?</strong></p>

<p>I remember trying to explain a VCR to older relatives.Â  It wasnâ€™t that
they were less intelligent or unable to grasp the overall concept, it
was that it wasnâ€™t a necessary thing to learn in their opinion.Â  They
werenâ€™t interested in the technology; they had fared fine in life so far
without having to watch a recorded episode of anything.Â  In fact, most
of their lives were spent without television altogether.</p>

<p>While not exactly the same, there are similarities in this situation
with senior executives in todayâ€™s workforce and cybersecurity.Â  But in
this scenario, there is a risk incurred by lack of interest.</p>

<p><strong>With Age Comes Wisdom</strong></p>

<p>The experience and wisdom that put these senior-level execs at the top
has likely developed over time, making them a generation or two older
than their team.Â  With that level of responsibility comes access to
information that is usually confidential and most of it integral to a
companyâ€™s success or failure.Â  Also consider that at that level, these
individuals are busy, so they have a team doing a lot of work for them,
and in order to do that successfully, they need access to different
data.</p>

<p>This means two things:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>A lot of people with a lot of different access â€“ leaving a lot of
gaps for security breaches to occur</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That senior executive didnâ€™t move through their career with strong
security habits, so not only is their access easily compromised, but
they may often pass out access to one set of information without
realizing it is linked to another set.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p><strong>From the Ground Up</strong></p>

<p>You may not be at the top yourself, and you arenâ€™t going to change the
habits overnight of someone who has worked without a cybersecurity plan
for twenty or thirty years, but you can work to accommodate their way of
working.Â  As a security advisor, you can ensure that the company is
ensuring that there is a system of checks and balances along the way, as
well as a plan that supports the business should there be a breach.</p>

<p>Every generation has a learning curve to work with, this one is
everyoneâ€™s problem and cannot be ignored.Â  Consider it like employee
profit sharing, everyone has to work together for the greater good â€“
and a company that is still around to work for!</p>
