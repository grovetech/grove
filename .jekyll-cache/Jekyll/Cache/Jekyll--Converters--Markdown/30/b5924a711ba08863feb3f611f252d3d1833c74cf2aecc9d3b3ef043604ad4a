I"_<p>The dark web is often known for the illegal activities conducted there,
and while not everything on the dark web is illegal, it’s most appealing
factor is its anonymity. The dark web is often a place where stolen data
and personal information is bought and sold following a data breach or
hacking incident. An article
on <a href="https://www.experian.com/blogs/ask-experian/heres-how-much-your-personal-information-is-selling-for-on-the-dark-web/" rel="nofollow">Experian</a> takes
a look at what your personal information is worth on the dark web and
how you can help protect yourself from being exposed.</p>

<p><strong>How are criminals purchasing this information on the dark web?</strong></p>

<p><strong> </strong>Information can be bought and sold a variety of ways on the dark
web, however the most common include:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Purchasing data as a single item, such as a Social Security number.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Purchasing bulk data, such as batches of the same information.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Purchasing bundled data containing various types of information</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>bundled together.</p>
    </blockquote>
  </li>
</ol>

<p> </p>

<p><strong>The cost of personal information on the dark web fluctuates, but what
is responsible for the change?</strong></p>

<p>The four main factors driving the cost of personal information on the
dark web include:</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>The type of data and the demand for it. </strong>The cost often depends
    <blockquote>
      <p>on the type of data and the need or ability to use that data.</p>
    </blockquote>
  </li>
  <li><strong>The supply of the data</strong>. If there is less data available for a
    <blockquote>
      <p>cybercriminal to purchase, the value of that data increases.</p>
    </blockquote>
  </li>
  <li><strong>The balance of the accounts. </strong>The higher the balance in the
    <blockquote>
      <p>stolen account, the higher the cost of the data. The balance could
be the amount of money in a particular account as well as points
value (i.e., a loyalty account).</p>
    </blockquote>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Limits or the ability to reuse the data. </strong>If the data being
    <blockquote>
      <p>purchase can only be used once, the value of that data is worth
less to a cybercriminal than data that can be reused multiple
times or across various platforms.</p>
    </blockquote>
  </li>
</ol>

<p><strong>How can you protect yourself?</strong></p>

<p>Data breaches are becoming increasingly common and are often outside of
your control. It is important to help minimize your risk of a hacker
gaining access to your accounts by utilizing healthy password practices
and by keeping your personal information private unless it is absolutely
necessary to share.  Keeping antivirus software and all other software
up to date will also play a crucial role in protecting your information,
as these updates could contain security patches to fix potential
vulnerabilities that could expose your information.</p>

<p>It is also recommended to run a dark web scan on your email address,
utilize a dark web monitoring tool and monitor your credit report for
potential red flags that your identity may have been compromised.</p>
