I"£<p>Grove Technologies cares about your business and the safety of your employees, its on that note
that we have decided to start teleworking, a decision that many of our clients have already made

need assistance please call <a href="tel:+18882539103" class="link">888-253-9103</a> for assistance or email <a href="mailto:support@grovetech.co" class="link">support@grovetech.co</a>.

<p>As of this writing, the respiratory disease COVID-19 has caused nearly
3000 deaths and infected over 80,000 people worldwide. There are
relatively few cases in North America currently, but that could increase
significantly. For high-quality information about COVID-19, turn to the
<a href="https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019" rel="nofollow">World Health
Organization</a>
and the US <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/index.html" rel="nofollow">Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention</a>.</p>

<p>For now, the Centers for Disease Control are recommending <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/preparing-individuals-communities.html" rel="nofollow">sensible
precautions</a>.
They include regular hand washing or using alcohol-based hand sanitizer,
covering coughs and sneezes (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3vw0hIs2LEg" rel="nofollow">with your
elbow</a>), and staying
home and avoiding public spaces if you‚Äôre feeling unwell. (These are
smart things to do during flu season anyway, given that 10,000 people in
the US have died of influenza already this season.)</p>

<p>What if local health officials were to declare a quarantine? Without
lapsing into doomsday scenarios, it is always reasonable to make sure
that you are personally ready for a natural disaster or other emergency.
The Prepared has <a href="https://theprepared.com/wuhan-coronavirus/" rel="nofollow">a detailed
guide</a> to help you
prepare for a COVID-19 scare or quarantine.</p>

<p>We want to focus on how organizations‚Äîeither those you run or work
for‚Äîmight prepare for a public health scare or possible quarantine,
particularly in the context of your technology use. Here are our
thoughts, and contact us if you want help with your preparedness plans.‚Äã</p>

<p><strong>Infection Prevention</strong></p>

<p>If your organization has numerous employees or serves the public, put
some thought into how you can reduce the chance of infection. That might
include providing hand sanitizer dispensers, wiping down frequently
touched surfaces with household cleaners, and a more frequent cleaning
schedule for restrooms.</p>

<p>For an Apple-specific tip, try using or encouraging the use of Apple Pay
to reduce the need to touch credit card
terminals!</p>

<p>Also, it‚Äôs best to avoid shaking hands with customers and colleagues.
Perhaps the Japanese custom of bowing will gain traction elsewhere in
the world.‚Äã</p>

<p><strong>Internal Communications</strong></p>

<p>In the event that public health officials discourage people from
gathering, think about how your company will communicate internally with
people working from home. Many organizations allow such flexibility now
anyway, so it‚Äôs likely that yours has at least informal communication
channels via phone and email, and chat systems like Slack.</p>

<p>Consider formalizing those channels if need be, and if your directory
service doesn‚Äôt already contain this information, publish a list of
phone numbers and email addresses so everyone can contact co-workers
easily. If your organization relies on IP telephony, make sure everyone
understands how to use softphones or can configure an office phone at
home. If you have a switchboard, investigate how it can be operated
remotely.</p>

<p>If your organization‚Äôs email system is usually available only from
computers owned by the organization, make sure webmail access is enabled
and that everyone understands how to access it. Similarly, it‚Äôs worth
making sure everyone has email access from their phones.</p>

<p>Chat systems like <a href="https://slack.com/" rel="nofollow">Slack</a> or <a href="https://products.office.com/en-us/microsoft-teams/group-chat-software" rel="nofollow">Microsoft
Teams</a>
can be effective ways for far-flung groups to communicate because they
provide real-time communication segregated into topic- or group-specific
channels. If you‚Äôre not already using such a system and would like to
investigate adding it to your communications strategy, contact us for
advice.‚Äã</p>

<p><strong>Remote Access to Organizational Services</strong></p>

<p>For connectivity to office-based file servers and other systems, make
sure everyone has access to your VPN and knows how to use it. (Don‚Äôt
have a VPN, or virtual private network? Again, call us‚Äîa VPN is an
essential way to provide remote access while ensuring security.)</p>

<p>Are there any specialized servers or services, such as an accounting
system, that have security safeguards related to specific access points?
Think about what additional access may need to be provided for an
employee working from home.‚Äã</p>

<p><strong>Physical Environment</strong></p>

<p>If most or all employees are working from home, what does that mean for
your office? Do physical security systems or climate settings need to be
adjusted? Do you want to set up video cameras or other remote monitoring
hardware? Who‚Äôs going to water the plants? On a more serious note, if
you have on-premises servers, make sure they can be administered
entirely remotely, including power cycling.</p>

<p>It‚Äôs also worth determining who will have responsibility for the office
in the event of problems, which could still occur even if no one is
there. What if a water pipe in the building breaks, or there‚Äôs a
burglary? Make sure it‚Äôs clear who will respond.‚Äã</p>

<p><strong>Business Functions</strong></p>

<p>Think about the regularly scheduled aspects of running the business,
with an eye toward those that might assume the presence of certain
people. Can they run payroll, accounts receivable, and accounts payable
remotely? Make sure that every key position has at least one backup, so
if one person falls ill, the organization‚Äôs ability to function won‚Äôt be
compromised.</p>

<p>If international travel is a significant part of your organization‚Äôs
mission, you‚Äôre already figuring out how to compensate through
videoconferencing and similar technologies. But if you regularly travel
only within the country or your area, think about which trips are
essential and which can be replaced using online conferencing tools.</p>

<p>Finally, consider how your clients and customers will react to the
situation. It‚Äôs unfortunately likely that there will be less work taking
place, so you may see decreased revenues, but certain organizations may
see an increased workload. For instance, if the number of patients in
hospitals skyrockets, those who support healthcare systems may struggle
under the load alongside the doctors and nurses.</p>

<p>We certainly hope that all these preparations prove unnecessary, but
they‚Äôre worthwhile regardless. Too many businesses have failed after a
fire, hurricane, or earthquake renders an office uninhabitable, and such
natural disasters are all too common. As the Boy Scout motto says, ‚ÄúBe
prepared.‚Äù</p>
