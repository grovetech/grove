I"©<p>For years, youâ€™ve used the App Store app to install operating system and
app updates on your Mac. Thatâ€™s still true for apps, but with macOS
10.14 Mojave, Apple moved operating system updates to the new Software
Update preference pane, which replaces the old App Store preference
pane. Open System Preferences &gt; Software Update to check your version
of macOS and access available updatesâ€”there will be an Update Now
button to click. You should also visit this pane to tell your Mac how to
best handle system and app updates: Donâ€™t select â€œAutomatically keep my
Mac up to dateâ€ because updates might come at an inconvenient time for
you. Instead, click Advanced and then select â€œCheck for updatesâ€ and
â€œInstall system data files and security updatesâ€â€”theyâ€™re important.
Unless youâ€™re low on drive space, selecting â€œDownload new updates when
availableâ€ is fine, since that will make updating faster. However, keep
â€œInstall macOS updatesâ€ and â€œInstall app updates from the App Storeâ€ off
so you can choose when to update.</p>
