I"Ç<p>Heads up! If youâ€™re using an older 15-inch MacBook Proâ€”the version
with lots of ports that predates the current Thunderbolt 3
modelsâ€”<a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2019/06/important-notice-for-batteries-in-certain-macbook-pro-units/" rel="nofollow">Apple has started a recall
program</a>Â to
replace batteries that could explode and catch on fire. (<a href="https://twitter.com/whitepanda/status/1133847982317723648" rel="nofollow">Weâ€™re not
kidding.</a>)
The affected MacBook Pro models were sold primarily between September
2015 and February 2017. To find out if your 15-inch MacBook Pro is
affected,Â <a href="https://support.apple.com/15-inch-macbook-pro-battery-recall" rel="nofollow">enter its serial number into Appleâ€™s recall
page</a>.
If it is included in the recall, shut it down and stop using it
immediately! Contact Apple for a free battery replacement, and if you
need any assistance, donâ€™t hesitate to get in touch with us.</p>
