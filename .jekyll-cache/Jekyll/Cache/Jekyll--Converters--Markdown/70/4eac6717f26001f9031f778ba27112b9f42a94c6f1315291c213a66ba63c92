I"c<p>Split View on the Mac helps you focus on your work in one app—perhaps
a word processor—while providing access to one other app, like a Web
browser. (Make sure “Displays have separate Spaces” is selected in
System Preferences &gt; Mission Control.) Before macOS 10.15 Catalina, you
had to click and hold on the green full-screen button in the upper-left
corner of any window, drag that window to one side of the screen, and
click a window on the other side to put them side by side. Catalina
makes this easier to discover: hover over the green full-screen button
briefly and then choose Tile Window to Left of Screen or Tile Window to
Right of Screen before selecting a window on the other side of the
screen. If you don’t want a 50-50 split, drag the black divider bar
between the windows to adjust the proportions. To leave Split View, move
your pointer to the top of the screen to reveal the menu bar and then
click the green full-screen button.</p>
