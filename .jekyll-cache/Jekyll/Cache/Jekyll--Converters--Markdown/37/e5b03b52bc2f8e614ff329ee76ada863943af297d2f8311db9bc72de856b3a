I"H<p>Well it was not easy for me to do, however I must say it was a fun ride while it lasted. From early 2008 â€“ 2009 I hosted a Mac OSX Dashboard widget related podcast that went into the creation, design and coding of dashboard widgets. The podcast can be found <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/the-flip-side/id111529683">here</a> on iTunes for those interested in subscribing or listening to the shows.</p>

<p>It was an interesting venture for sure, my first and last attempt at podcasting, not saying it was not my cup of tea I certainly enjoyed it but one has to make a huge time commitment when making a quality show, and for the most part I considered my show to be mid par quality compared to those who obviously spent more time on their shows. The Flip Side, became a victim of pod-fading and eventually died.</p>

<p>While doing the show I got to talk to a lot of people and developers of widgets and it always amazed me the level of creativity and passion for their art never wavered and drove them forward, it was inspiring and I am glad that I was took a shot, did the show and made some great friends along the way.</p>

<p>I still develop Dashboard widgets and am available for anyone interested or has questions about creating widgets of their own. With that, I lay thee to rest Widget Show, you will not be forgotten.</p>
