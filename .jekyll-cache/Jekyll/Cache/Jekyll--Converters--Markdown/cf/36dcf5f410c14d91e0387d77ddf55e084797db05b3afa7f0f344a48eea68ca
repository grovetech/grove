I"-<p>Sad news: Apple is discontinuing its photo printing services, which enabled you to create and order physical prints, cards, calendars, and books from within Photos on the Mac. If you’re building such a project right now, be sure to place your order before September 30th, 2018. After that, Apple is directing users to download a Photos Project Extension from the Mac App Store. You’ll see this dialog whenever you click a project in Photos.</p>

<p>When you click the Open App Store button, Photos opens the App Store app and shows available Photos Project Extensions. (If you need to open this Mac App Store screen manually, search on appex:com.apple.photo-project.) Most of these extensions are free, since they’ll make their money when you order projects.</p>

<p>These extensions aren’t exact replacements for Apple’s projects, so let’s look briefly at what they provide.</p>

<h3 id="mimeo-photos">Mimeo Photos</h3>
<hr />
<p>The extension that comes closest to providing the same products and features as Apple’s print projects is <a href="https://www.mimeophotos.com/">Mimeo Photos</a>, which can create cards, calendars, and books. It offers a wide array of themes.</p>

<h3 id="motif">Motif</h3>
<hr />
<p><a href="https://www.motifphotos.com/">Motif</a> looks quite similar to Mimeo Photos, also enabling you to create cards, calendars, and books with selected photos, and it comes from RR Donnelley, the company that was previously Apple’s partner for print projects. It doesn’t offer as many themes or options as Mimeo Photos, but it has a better interface.</p>

<h3 id="shutterfly">Shutterfly</h3>
<hr />
<p>Even though the popular <a href="https://www.shutterfly.com/">Shutterfly</a> photo service’s Web site lets you go beyond the basics to put your photos on a vast number of objects, such as pillows, candles, and trivets, the company’s Photos extension is limited to photo books. Happily, it provides quite a few different sizes and bindings, and numerous themes for each.</p>

<h3 id="fujifilm-prints--gifts">Fujifilm Prints &amp; Gifts</h3>
<hr />
<p>The <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/fujifilm-prints-gifts/id1316083518?mt=12">Fujifilm Prints &amp; Gifts</a> extension lets you order prints, cards, wall art, mugs and drinkware, magnets, T-shirts, puzzles, iPhone cases, and much more. However, it has a non-standard interface (basically the company’s Web site), and every time we switched out of the extension, it crashed and forgot which photo we’d had selected.</p>

<h3 id="mpix">Mpix</h3>
<hr />
<p>Although <a href="https://www.mpix.com/">Mpix</a> seems to focus on prints, if you scroll down in the project list, the final option is Browse Mpix, which provides more possibilities, including photo books, calendars, collages, foil art prints, posters, keychains, magnets, playing cards, and business cards. Confusingly, with some of these items, Photos acts as nothing more than a window onto Mpix’s Web site, with no awareness of the photos you’ve selected.</p>

<p><img src="https://grovetech.co/assets/img/blog/2018/prints/image008.png" class="img-fluid rounded m-2" width="700" /></p>

<h3 id="whitewall">WhiteWall</h3>
<hr />
<p><a href="https://us.whitewall.com/">WhiteWall</a> focuses entirely on prints, with high-end choices for exotic papers and options for mounting and framing. Supported sizes range from 8” x 6” up to 48” x 36”. Unfortunately, the WhiteWall prices seemed high (a framed photo was between $130 and $530, depending on size), and once you select a particular paper or frame choice, there is no way to try another with the same photo without starting another project.</p>

<p><img src="https://grovetech.co/assets/img/blog/2018/prints/image009.png" class="img-fluid rounded m-2" width="700" /></p>

<h3 id="wix">Wix</h3>
<hr />
<p>Unlike all the others, the Wix extension doesn’t put photos on physical products at all. Instead, it’s designed to create on-screen photo albums for Web sites designed with the <a href="https://www.wix.com/">Wix</a> service. As such, it’s potentially extremely useful for Wix users, but not at all for everyone else.</p>

<p><img src="https://grovetech.co/assets/img/blog/2018/prints/image010.png" class="img-fluid rounded m-2" width="700" /></p>

<p>It’s too bad that Apple is getting out of the print project business since the interfaces from these extensions tend not to be as good as what we’re used to from Apple. But if you like making yourself a calendar every year, you’ll probably do fine with Mimeo Photos or Motif, and the rest of the extensions do extend Photos’ printing capabilities in a big way.</p>
