I"•<p>Although most of whatâ€™s new in iOS 12 are new features, one change for
changeâ€™s sake may throw you. In iOS 11 on an iPad, you would bring up
Control Center by swiping up from the bottom of the screen, just like on
all iPhones other than the iPhone X. With iOS 12, however, Apple brought
the iPad in line with the iPhone X and the recently released iPhone XR,
XS, and XS Max. Swiping up from the bottom of the screen on the iPad now
reveals the Dock, and if you continue swiping, the App Switcher. But no
Control Center! To bring up Control Center, swipe down from the
upper-right corner of the screenâ€”use the Wi-Fi and battery icons as a
reminder.</p>
