I"<p>If your Mac is acting up and you suspect a hardware problem, there’s an
easy first step that you can—and should—try before calling for tech
support: <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT202731" rel="nofollow">Apple
Diagnostics</a>. (On Mac
models released before June 2013, Apple instead included a similar set
of diagnostics called <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201257" rel="nofollow">Apple Hardware
Test</a>.)</p>

<p>Apple Diagnostics is a set of hardware test routines that Apple bakes
into every Mac. It tests numerous internal subsystems in your Mac,
including the CPU, memory, and firmware; displays and graphics adapters;
connectivity via USB, Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, and Thunderbolt; batteries and
power adapters on laptops; and more.</p>

<p>Before you run Apple Diagnostics, prepare your Mac with these steps:</p>

<ul>
  <li>If you have a firmware password enabled, <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204455" rel="nofollow">turn
it off</a> before
proceeding.</li>
  <li>If possible, pick a situation when the Mac is
most likely to experience the problem (such as right after turning
it on for the day, or when it’s unusually warm).</li>
  <li>Disconnect all external devices with the
following exceptions: the keyboard and mouse or trackpad, display,
Ethernet cable if you use it, and power adapter for laptops.</li>
  <li>If you’re testing a laptop, make sure it’s on a
flat, well-ventilated surface.</li>
  <li>Shut down your Mac.</li>
</ul>

<p>Once you’re ready, turn your Mac on while holding down the D key. (If
that doesn’t invoke Apple Diagnostics, try again, holding down Option-D
to attempt to start Apple Diagnostics over the Internet.) Keep holding
down until you see a screen asking you to choose your language. Once
you’ve done that, you’ll see a bar showing the progress of the
diagnostic tests, which should take only a few minutes.</p>

<p><strong>What to do if Apple Diagnostics reports an issue</strong></p>

<p>If Apple Diagnostics finds any issues, it suggests solutions and
provides reference codes. Write the reference codes down so you can
share them with tech support later, if necessary. Apple publishes a full
list of <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT203747" rel="nofollow">reference
codes</a>, but the list
generally doesn’t tell you much beyond what the Apple Diagnostics report
explains.</p>

<p>After you’ve read about the issues and solutions, you have four options.</p>

<ul>
  <li>For a second opinion, click the “Run the test
again” link. It’s not a bad idea to make sure that multiple tests
come up with the same results. If they don’t, that’s useful
information for tech support too.</li>
  <li>To get more information, including details
about service and support options from Apple, click the “Get
started” link. Doing so causes your Mac to start up in macOS
Recovery, open Safari, and display a Web page for Apple Support. It
asks for your location along with permission to read your Mac’s
serial number and reference codes before providing additional
details. If your Mac can’t access the Internet at this time, none of
this will work.</li>
  <li>To restart your Mac normally, click the Restart
button.</li>
  <li>To shut your Mac down normally, click the Shut
Down button.</li>
</ul>

<p>With a few exceptions, most problems identified by Apple Diagnostics
require service from an Apple Authorized Service Provider or Apple
itself.</p>

<ul>
  <li>If you get a note about USB or Thunderbolt
hardware, make sure you’ve disconnected any devices other than the
keyboard and pointing device and test again. If you have another
wired keyboard or pointing device, swap those in and test again.</li>
  <li>If Apple Diagnostics complains about your
laptop’s power adapter, disconnect it from both the wall and the
computer, reconnect it to both, and rerun the
test.</li>
  <li>One of the battery errors (PPT004) may require
updated diagnostic information. To confirm the problem, run Apple
Diagnostics over the Internet: shut down the Mac and start it up
again while holding Option-D.​</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>What to do if Apple Diagnostics doesn’t find any problems</strong></p>

<p>With any luck, you’ll see the coveted “No issues found” message. While
that doesn’t mean you’re imagining any problems, it does suggest that
they’re probably related to software and won’t require a hardware
repair. However, some infuriating problems are intermittent due to
solder connections being warm or cold, which is why it’s important to
test when they’re most likely to occur.</p>

<p>One final note: If you want to see the results of the last run of Apple
Diagnostics, open the System Information app and click Diagnostics under
the Hardware section.</p>
