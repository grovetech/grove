I"<p>Before iOS 12, Apple Maps was the only mapping app you could run on the
dashboard in a CarPlay-equipped automobile. But Maps doesn’t always work
well, and some people prefer directions from Google Maps or the
Google-owned Waze. Once you upgrade your iPhone to iOS 12 and update to
the latest version of Google Maps or Waze for iOS, you’ll be able to use
those apps on your CarPlay screen. Happy navigating!</p>
