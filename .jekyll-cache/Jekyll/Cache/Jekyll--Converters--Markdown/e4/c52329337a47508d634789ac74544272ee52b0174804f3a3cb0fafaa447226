<hr />
<p>Whether you need access to an old password or you’re helping a friend or family member, it helps to know how to retrieve an old password on your Mac. It’s easy to forget old passwords you have not used in a while. Maybe you got a request like this:</p>

<p>“I have to get into my old email account, but I cannot remember the password! Help!”</p>

<p>Not to worry! With Mac OS X, you can retrieve most passwords fairly easily with the Keychain utility app. Here’s a tip on how you can retrieve an old password.</p>

<h3 id="open-keychain-access">Open Keychain Access</h3>
<hr />

<p>Open Keychain Access in your Applications &gt; Utilities folder. It’s easy to recognize with the keychain symbol.</p>

<p>Keychain Access is the built-in password manager for Mac OS X. When you save any pass-words in your Mail application or Safari browser, Keychain Access stores them for you.</p>

<h3 id="search-for-your-password">Search for your Password</h3>
<hr />

<p>You may have a long list in here and scroll down to the one that you need, whether you are looking for your password for your email, website log-in, social media or app.</p>

<p>Double click on the one you need. A box will open up with the option to ‘Show Password’ at the bottom. In this example, we are retrieving a gmail password stored in Keychain.</p>

<h3 id="show-password">Show Password</h3>
<hr />

<p>Check this box and then the Keychain app will prompt you to enter in your admin user creden-tials for log in.</p>

<p>This is usually your main admin password you use to sign in to your computer.</p>

<p>Once you have authenticated, your forgotten password will be displayed right in the box next to ‘Show Password.’</p>
