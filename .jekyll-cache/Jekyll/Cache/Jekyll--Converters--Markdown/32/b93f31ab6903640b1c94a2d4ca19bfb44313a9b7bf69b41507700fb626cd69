<p>We want to take a moment to welcome Chris Sanborn back to the Grove Team! Chris a long time technologist in DC has worked for several notable organizations such as the Food &amp; Water Watch, NASA and others to help provide top notch Mac engineering services. Chris has joined us with the hopes to help us provide better Mac engineering services to our clients and to help us offer more strategic enterprise guidance for our clients.</p>

<p>We are excited to put him to work and to see what he can do and on that note‚Ä¶. Lets take a moment to learn a little bit more about Manavendra and how he came to be here at Grove!</p>

<h3 id="tell-us-about-yourself-your-history-of-how-you-got-started-with-systems-engineering-and-how-you-got-to-where-you-are-today">Tell us about yourself, your history of how you got started with Systems Engineering and how you got to where you are today.</h3>

  <p>I worked with the founder, Jon Brown, way back when we were at a non-profit together and always thought he was a technical wizard.  Although my path eventually led back to government work, Ive always enjoyed working with him and his crew.  Now that Im here at Grove Im hoping to be able to keep my skills sharp and learn from other team members.  Grove is on the front line when it comes to Mac support, so I enjoy being able to do my time in the ‚Äútrenches‚Äù and learn from it.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Jon always surrounds himself with the best people and best technology, so being able to be a part of that supply chain has been awesome.  I have always wanted to be a bonified Apple Consultant an being able to work with Grove has given me the opportunuty to learn the ins and outs of keeping a Apple Consultancy relationship with Apple, which I found out was surpisingly challenging!</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I get joy from being able to fix the issues people have.  Back in the day, I went into filmmaking to make films that helped people heal and tackle the difficult issues in their lives.  Relationships, abandonment, anger, pain.  Now I do the same, except im helping people heal and tackle the difficult issues they are having with their Macs, most of which still revolve around Relationships (with their Macs), abandonment (my job is to stop the Mac from abandoning you), anger (no, dont throw that Mac through a wall, I can fix it!), and pain (a proper functioning Mac causes no pain!).   Im still fixing people‚Äôs problems, just from a different perspective.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I love the outdoors and everything nature.  On beautiful days I take a portable desk and my wifi-hotspot to somewhere beautiful and setup my work area outdoors for the day.  I love hiking, exploring new places and small towns.</p>
