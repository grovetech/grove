I",<p>We don’t often talk much about web development or web optimization but recently we started investigating alternative methods / means to our web hosting environment. Currently we are using JustHost’s shared web hosting for jonbrown.org/blog. We are using their lowest shared hosting tier at which costs us $6 per month. We recently did quite a bit to optimize our site and I figured I would share our secret recipe for success that helped us improve our overall web speed rank by almost 90%. Having a website that is faster obviously is better.</p>
