I"ò<p>Although spam remains as much of a scourge as ever, spam filters have
improved enough that most people see relatively little spam and lose
relatively few legitimate messages (known as â€œhamâ€) to spam filters.
However, good email messages are still sometimes caught by spam filters.
To reduce the chance of missing an important message, consider making a
â€œham filter.â€ A ham filter looks for certain wordsâ€”usually proper
nounsâ€”that are likely to appear only in legitimate messages and then
marks such messages as Not Spam or moves them out of a Spam folder.
(This capability is available in Gmail and can be emulated with multiple
rules that you create in Appleâ€™s Mail preferences, and likely in other
systems as well; ask us about yours if youâ€™re not sure.) Useful ham
words include the name of your city, local high school or college names,
club names or abbreviations, industry-specific terms, and any other
words that are specific to your community or profession. Always test a
possible ham word by first searching for it in your Spam folder to make
sure it appears only in legitimate messages.</p>
