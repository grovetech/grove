I"N<p>Whenever Apple releases hot new hardware, it’s tempting to order the
latest and greatest and then put your old Mac or iPhone up for sale on a
classifieds site like Craigslist. If you do that, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/craigslist/comments/bkjw6f/this_is_probably_a_scammer_but/" rel="nofollow">be cautious about
potential
buyers</a>—it’s
increasingly common for a scammer to request that you ship them the
device and then to “pay” you by forging payment email from PayPal or
using a stolen PayPal account (whose owner will likely get PayPal to
take the money back from you). Instead, insist on an in-person meeting
in a public place and payment in cash or via a digital method like Apple
Pay Cash or Venmo that can’t be canceled once you accept the money. Or,
if the location and payment amount (under $1000) work, meet in a nearby
post office and request payment via money order
(<a href="https://www.usps.com/shop/money-orders.htm" rel="nofollow">US</a> or
<a href="https://www.usps.com/shop/money-orders.htm" rel="nofollow">Canada</a>) that you
can verify on the spot. Craigslist has <a href="https://www.craigslist.org/about/scams" rel="nofollow">more
advice</a>.</p>
