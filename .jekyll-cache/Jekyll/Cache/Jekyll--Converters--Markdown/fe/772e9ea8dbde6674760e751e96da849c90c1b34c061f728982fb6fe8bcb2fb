I";<p>Do you end up with so many tabs in Safari that it becomes impossible to
read the truncated tab titles? There’s no shame in that, and Safari
12—which comes with macOS 10.14 Mojave and is a free update for 10.12
Sierra and 10.13 High Sierra—now offers an option to add an icon
representing the Web site to each open tab. Called a <em>favicon,</em> this
tiny image is usually carefully designed to identify its site and makes
it easier to pick out the tab. To enable the feature, open Safari &gt;
Preferences &gt; Tabs and select “Show website icons in tabs.” Unlike
other Web browsers, Safari never shrinks a regular tab to just the icon,
so you’ll always see the icon and some text.</p>
