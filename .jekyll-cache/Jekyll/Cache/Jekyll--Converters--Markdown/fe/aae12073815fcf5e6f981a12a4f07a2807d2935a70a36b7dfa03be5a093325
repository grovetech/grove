I"‡<p>If you run a company, you know how much work onboarding a new employee
can be. Beyond teaching them the ropes of your business, they‚Äôll need a
Mac and potentially an iPhone or iPad as well. Setting those devices up
with all the right apps, settings, and logins can take days or even
weeks. And that‚Äôs just for one person‚Äîimagine if you need to lather,
rinse, and repeat for dozens or even hundreds of new employees?</p>

<p>The solution is Apple Business Manager, which ensures that every Apple
device you purchase is associated with your corporate account‚Äîand in
some cases, with a particular user‚Äîbefore it‚Äôs shipped to you. That
enables zero-touch configuration and makes manual setup a thing of the
past. Here‚Äôs how we make this happen.</p>

<p>We‚Äôll work with someone at your company‚Äîyour Business Contact‚Äîto set
you up with two Apple programs: Apple Custom Store and Apple Business
Manager. Your Business Contact will merely need to respond to some email
messages from Apple and have a call with Apple to verify that they can
agree to Apple‚Äôs Terms &amp; Conditions on behalf of your company.‚Äã</p>

<p><strong>Apple Custom Store</strong></p>

<p>The first program, Apple Custom Store, provides a customized corporate
store for purchasing Apple devices. That‚Äôs important because all devices
purchased through your Apple Custom Store are automatically tied to your
company. In fact, they‚Äôre connected to your company until you
intentionally release them while decommissioning, which can help protect
against theft or employees keeping devices they shouldn‚Äôt.</p>

<p>Even more important, all new Mac purchases must go through the Apple
Custom Store because there‚Äôs no easy way to add Macs purchased in any
other way to Apple Business Manager.</p>

<p>Once you‚Äôre set up with an Apple Custom Store, we can suggest custom
device configurations tailored to your company‚Äôs needs and even create
templates for systems customized for different job roles. As a bonus,
you‚Äôll receive special ‚Äúloyalty pricing‚Äù based on your annual purchase
volume.‚Äã</p>

<p><strong>Apple Business Manager</strong></p>

<p>The second program, Apple Business Manager, is what enables you to
enroll and manage devices purchased through your Apple Custom Store.
When we say ‚Äúmanage‚Äù we‚Äôre talking about mobile device management, or
MDM. In essence, MDM systems allow IT administrators to define
‚Äúprofiles‚Äù that specify your company‚Äôs settings and policies. Those
might be particular to a user, such as configuring email login
credentials, or they might be general to everyone, such as security
policies that require all iOS devices to use a six-digit passcode and
Macs to turn on their screensavers after 2 minutes and require a
password to unlock. And, of course, an MDM system lets your company
control when to install operating system updates, ensuring that nothing
happens before you‚Äôre ready.</p>

<p>You use Apple Business Manager to associate a new device purchased from
your Apple Custom Store with the employee who will be receiving it. When
the device arrives, the employee unboxes it and turns it on, and your
MDM system goes to work downloading apps and configuring settings. Once
the employee signs in with their credentials, the MDM system continues
to configure the device for that person. No one from IT even has to
touch it‚Äîhence ‚Äúzero-touch‚Äù configuration.</p>

<p>Enrolling your devices in your MDM system via Apple Business Manager
doesn‚Äôt just help with initial deployment. Employee turnover is a fact
of life, and with a device in Apple Business Manager, you can use your
MDM system to redeploy a device quickly by wiping it and re-enrolling it
for the new employee.</p>

<p>We recommend that all Apple-using businesses purchase through an Apple
Custom Store and use Apple Business Manager to tie those devices to the
company‚Äôs MDM system. Contact us for more information about what‚Äôs
involved, and for our MDM recommendations.</p>
