I"Œ<p>This week we talked about the fact over 50% of iDevice users have updated their devices to iOS 11.</p>

<p>Well this Tuesday the 31/10/2017 Apple has released iOS 11.1 which fixes a security concern know as a KRACK attack.</p>

<p>The KRACK attack is a hack on wireless networks allowing hackers to decrypt Wi-Fi traffic which means the hacker can: eavesdrop on communications, perform man-in-the-middle attacks, hijack connections, and more.</p>

<p>This is not a fault specifically with iDevices or one caused by Apple but an industry wide security flaw with any device that uses WPA2 passwords on a WIFI connection.</p>

<p>However this is a sophisticated attack and it is not likely to affect many people.
If your iDevice has iOS 11, the download for iOS 11.1 is in: Settings &gt; General &gt; Software Update.</p>

<p>iOS 11.1 is available for iPhone 5s users and later, iPad Pros, iPad Air &amp; later, iPad mini 2 &amp; later.</p>

<p>As well as the major security flaw with WPA2, iOS 11.1 addresses other issues across iDevices which have a 3D Touch display mainly the use of the Application Switcher.</p>

<p>iOS 11.1 also includes 70 new emoji and other fixes and improvements.</p>

<p>You can read more about iOS 11.1 here: <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT208222">https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT208222</a></p>

<p>Carry out this update or schedule it ASAP the next time you are on WIFI.</p>
