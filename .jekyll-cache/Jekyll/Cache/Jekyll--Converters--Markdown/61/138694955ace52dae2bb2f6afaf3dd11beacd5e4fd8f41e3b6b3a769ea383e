I"g<p>One of the big no-nos with passwords is sending them to other people as
plain text in email or a text message conversation. You presumably trust
your recipient with the password, but what if their email was hacked or
phone stolen? Instead, always use a site like
<a href="https://1ty.me/" rel="nofollow">1ty.me</a> or <a href="https://onetimesecret.com/" rel="nofollow">One-Time
Secret</a>, which lets you turn a
password into a Web link that can be opened only once. Send that link to
the recipient, and when they get the password out, they can store it in
a secure password manager like
<a href="https://1password.com/" rel="nofollow">1Password</a> or
<a href="https://www.lastpass.com/" rel="nofollow">LastPass</a>.</p>
