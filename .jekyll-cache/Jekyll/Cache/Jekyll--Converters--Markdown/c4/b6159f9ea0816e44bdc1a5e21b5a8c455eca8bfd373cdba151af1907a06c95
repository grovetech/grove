I"e<p>Along with the now-ubiquitous videoconferencing, screen sharing and
online presentations have become vastly more common during the pandemic.
This isn’t yet another article about how to give a better presentation
or feel more confident. (Although those might happen too.) The goal of
this article is to help you avoid situations that could embarrass you in
front of clients, colleagues, or bosses. Follow this advice and you
could avoid an unfortunate happenstance that might even cause you to be
fired.</p>

<p>Here’s the problem. Even more so than before the pandemic, our Macs feel
like personal spaces. Just as you’d add a houseplant and a special photo
to your desk at work, you’ve probably personalized your Mac in a variety
of ways. Custom desktop wallpaper, for instance, or a screensaver that
displays favorite photos. Plus, you may carry on personal conversations,
possibly even intimate ones, if you catch our drift, using the same Mac
that you use for communicating with those aforementioned clients,
colleagues, and bosses.</p>

<p>We’re not here to admonish you or nag about inappropriate behavior.
(Though we will encourage you to consider some sage advice from a
friend’s mother, who noted drily that you should never put anything on
the Internet that you don’t want to appear on the front page of the New
York Times. And that was before Twitter.)</p>

<p>No, as we said, the goal here is to help you avoid the embarrassment
caused by people who are viewing your screen seeing things they
shouldn’t see, something that the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/21/style/screen-share-disasters.html">New York Times has also
covered</a>.
Some areas of concern include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Desktop &amp; Screen Saver:</strong> Jobs have been lost by inappropriate
selections for desktop wallpaper and photo screen savers. Make sure,
if you’re ever going to share your screen, that randomly chosen
desktop pictures and folders of screen saver photos don’t contain
anything that could be problematic. To be safe, choose an
Apple-provided desktop picture and a pattern-based screen saver in
System Preferences &gt; Desktop &amp; Screen Saver.

  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Icons on the Desktop:</strong> We all toss files on the desktop, but if
preview icons or even filenames could cause trouble—you might not
want your boss seeing Resumé.doc—corral them in another folder
before you share your screen. Also note that many videoconferencing
apps can limit their screen sharing to particular windows rather
than the entire screen, which prevents people from seeing your
desktop.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Web browser tabs:</strong> Limiting screen sharing to a particular window
won’t help if it’s a Web browser window with multiple tabs. Even if
you avoid accidentally navigating to a tab with NSFW content, its
title alone might be problematic. For safety, always start a new
browser window when sharing Web content.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Open apps and documents:</strong> As with icons on the desktop when
sharing your entire screen, you may not want just anyone seeing what
other apps and documents you have open. Again, stick to sharing a
specific window. To avoid mistakes when selecting the window to
share, we recommend hiding or quitting all unrelated apps before
sharing your screen.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Document comments:</strong> When collaborating on a document, some people
are less than politic with their in-document comments. If comments
are visible when you’re sharing a document with people who wouldn’t
otherwise see them, hard feelings could ensue. Make sure to hide or
resolve such comments before sharing.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Notifications:</strong> Even if you have hidden or quit Calendar,
Messages, Mail, and similar apps, their notifications could still
appear at an inopportune time. You might not want colleagues to know
about an ob-gyn appointment, meeting with a potential employer, or
racy conversations with a coworker. The solution is Do Not Disturb,
easily enabled from Control Center in macOS 11 Big Sur and by
scrolling up in Today view in Notification Center in earlier
versions of macOS. Also, although it won’t help with online screen
sharing, it’s a good idea to enable the “When mirroring to TVs and
projectors” option in System Preferences &gt; Notifications &gt; Do Not
Disturb.

  </li>
</ul>

<p>This may all sound a little overwhelming, but there is one trick that
will help you avoid most of these problems at once. In System
Preferences &gt; Users &amp; Groups, create a new user account dedicated to
screen sharing and presentations. In that user account, you can be sure
to have innocuous desktop pictures, screen savers, clean Web browser
windows, and permanent Do Not Disturb. The hardest part will be figuring
out the best way to share documents you use in presentations between
your accounts (try the /Users/Shared folder or an online file sharing
solution like Dropbox). Then, before you start a call when you’ll need
to share your screen, choose your new account from the Fast User
Switching menu from the right side of the menu bar (set up that menu in
System Preferences &gt; Users &amp; Groups &gt; Login Options).</p>

<p>One final piece of advice. When you’ve accomplished what you need to by
sharing your screen, stop sharing it and switch back to video. That way,
you can’t accidentally do something in the shared window that might be
embarrassing. Similarly, when a meeting is over or you’re dropping off
for a while, it’s best to leave the call. Stopping video and muting
audio are good tools, but it’s easy to click in the wrong spot
accidentally and think you’re safe when, in fact, your mic or camera is
still live.</p>
