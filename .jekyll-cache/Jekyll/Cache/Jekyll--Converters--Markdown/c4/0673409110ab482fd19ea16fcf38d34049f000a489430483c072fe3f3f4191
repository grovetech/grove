<hr />

<p>Running low on space on your iPhone or iPad in iOS 11? This problem may
be easier to deal with than you expect because Apple has added a quick
way to free up storage space by removing unneeded apps. Go to Settings
&gt; General &gt; iPhone/iPad Storage, where youâ€™ll see a Recommendations
section. This section may include an option to Offload Unused Apps with
an estimate of how much space you could save. Tap Enable to allow iOS to
remove apps that you havenâ€™t launched in a whileâ€”this happens <em>only</em>
if youâ€™re low on space. iOS preserves any documents or data associated
with the offloaded app, and the appâ€™s icon remains on the Home screen,
with a cloud badge. Tapping the app icon reloads it from the App Store,
assuming itâ€™s still available. If you find yourself waiting for apps to
reload often and you can clear space in other ways, you can disable the
feature in Settings &gt; iTunes &amp; App Store &gt; Offload Unused Apps.</p>
