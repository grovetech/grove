I"ç<p>If you‚Äôre working on an iPad with a physical keyboard‚Äîeither a Bluetooth keyboard or an iPad Pro with Apple‚Äôs Smart Keyboard‚Äîthere are quite a few keyboard shortcuts you can use to work faster. Many are what you‚Äôd guess if you have Mac experience; for instance, Command-F generally maps to Find. But to see a list of supported keyboard shortcuts in an app, simply press and hold the Command key on the keyboard until an information panel appears. Some apps, like Calendar (shown below), even have multiple pages of shortcuts; swipe to see them all. Not all apps will display the cheat sheet, but most of Apple‚Äôs productivity apps do.</p>
