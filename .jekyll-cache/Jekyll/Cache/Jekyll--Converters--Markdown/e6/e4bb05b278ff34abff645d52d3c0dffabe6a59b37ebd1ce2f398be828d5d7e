I"Œ<p>In 2020, it seems like there is a new headline just about every week of
another major company getting hit with a ransomware attack.Â Â Per the New
York Times, â€œA woman died from treatment delays after a hospital in
Germany hit by a cyberattack wasÂ <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/18/world/europe/cyber-attack-germany-ransomeware-death.html">forced to turn
away</a>Â emergency
patients. HackersÂ <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/hacker-releases-information-on-las-vegas-area-students-after-officials-dont-pay-ransom-11601297930">released private information, including Social
Security
numbers</a>,
from a Las Vegas school district. A coronavirusÂ <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/03/technology/clinical-trials-ransomware-attack-drugmakers.html">vaccine trial was
bogged
down</a>Â in
recent weeks when researchers were locked out of their data.â€Â  Adding to
this you see major companies like Garmin getting their core
infrastructure hit and having to pay a 10-million-dollar ransom to get
access to their data back.</p>

<p>How did this problem get so bad?Â  In essence, cyber criminals found that
the payout is higher and easier with ransomware that other types of
cybercrime.Â  Once other cyber criminal organizations noticed and caught
on, the race was on.Â  To compound matters even further, companies have
started increasingly purchasing cybersecurity liability insurance
against ransomware attacks.Â  This is a double edged because if a company
has liability insurance, then they will likely pay the ransom making
them more enticing of a target.</p>

<p>So, what exactly is ransomware?Â  Essentially ransomware involves an
attacker typically performing a phishing attack against an unsuspecting
employee of said corporation.Â  If the phish is successful and the
attacker has access to the inside network, they will scour the network
looking for valuable information such as confidential customer files,
database, and other essential intellectual property to the
organization.Â  Once they have the information, they will encrypt the
information or systems with the attackerâ€™s private key so that
information or systems are inaccessible without the attackerâ€™s private
key to decrypt the information.Â  The attacker will contact by various
communication channel means the target and ask for payment (i.e., â€œthe
ransomâ€) for the private key for the organization to get access to their
files.</p>

<p>A common question asked is should the company pay the ransom?Â  The
answer is it depends.Â  Companies should consider the pros and cons of
paying and what essentially is inaccessible.Â  If a companyâ€™s strategic
or critical assets such as customer data used for company business or
the nature of your business is time sensitive, (i.e., a hospital) than
companies might want to consider paying.Â  If company assets that are hit
have full backups and are not critical to essential operations, they
might want to consider not paying and performing recovery operations
immediately as part of their incident response/contingency plans.Â 
Another factor that companies should be aware of is whom the intended
ransomware payment is going to.Â  Recent policy guidance was issued by
theÂ <a href="https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/sm1142">Treasure
Department</a>Â stating
that companies must ensure ransomware payment are not directed towards
entities that were terrorist countries or organizations,Â  Per
theÂ <a href="https://www.natlawreview.com/article/ransomware-payments-may-violate-sanctions-laws-us-treasury-department-warns">NLR</a>,
â€œUnder the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) and the
Trading with the Enemy Act (TWEA), among other laws, executive orders,
and regulations, U.S. persons generally are prohibited from engaging in
transactions â€” directly or indirectly â€” with individuals or entities
â€œdesignatedâ€ on OFACâ€™s Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked
Persons List (SDN List), as well as persons or entities covered by
comprehensive country embargoes (e.g., Cuba, Iran, North Korea, Syria,
and the Crimea region of Ukraine).â€Â  This should be carefully discussed
and determined with company legal and law enforcement prior to
authorizing payment as there could criminal liabilities if found actions
were to occur.</p>

<p>So, what can a company do to prevent or at least minimize the threat of
ransomware?Â  While there is no magic panacea to prevent ransomware, a
company should take the following steps.Â  Companies should remain
vigilant and maintain software patches to minimize vulnerabilities
attackers might exploit to plan ransomware.Â  Companies should ensure
network boundary devices are hardened and minimize unnecessary ports or
services access to their infrastructure.Â  Companies should remain
vigilant and ensure frequent user security awareness training to be
aware of the latest threat vectors to prevent phishing attacks.Â </p>
