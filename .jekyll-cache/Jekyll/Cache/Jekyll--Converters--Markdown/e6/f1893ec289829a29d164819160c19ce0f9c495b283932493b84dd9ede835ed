I"i<p>Well if you were like me you were thrilled about the idea of Apples new Snow Leopard Server feature Mobile Access server. So great what is it, what does it do? Well it keeps your private web, ical and mail data secure without the use of a VPN and its really easy to setup. Great I was sold, and I started down the path of figuring out the Mobile Access Server. The more I got down into the nitty gritty of the setup the more I realized just what a 1.0 feature this really is. After some trial and error I decided to share my experience with others in the hopes of fully Understanding the Mobile Access Server.</p>
