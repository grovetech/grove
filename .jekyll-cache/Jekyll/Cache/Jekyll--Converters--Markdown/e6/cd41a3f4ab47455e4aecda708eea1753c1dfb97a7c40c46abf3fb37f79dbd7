I"N<p>Some of the trickiest editing and proofreading problems are related to
characters you can’t typically see on the screen: spaces, tabs, and
returns. Just because they’re invisible doesn’t mean they don’t affect
the look of a document, often in negative ways. For instance:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>An extra space can cause an awkward jump from one word to the next,
or it could push punctuation away from the final word in a clause or
sentence. And yes, current convention among professional publishers
and typographers calls for one space after a period, not two.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The wrong number of tabs might not be obvious until you add or
remove text from the line, at which point having too many or too few
tabs will suddenly mess up the formatting.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>An extra return causes a line break, something that you might
overlook if the return falls naturally where the line would break on
its own, but as you add or remove text, the line break could become
embarrassing.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>These and similar errors are easy to make or to encounter in copied and
pasted text. They’re equally easy to fix, but only if you know why
they’re happening. To help you identify them, most Mac word processors,
page layout programs, and text editors have a command or option called
something like “Show Invisibles.”</p>

<p>As you would expect from the name, Show Invisibles replaces previously
invisible characters with something you can see. Spaces are generally
replaced with a vertically centered dot, tabs with some sort of
right-pointing arrow, and returns with something that’s formally known
as a <em>pilcrow</em> but more commonly called a paragraph mark. Here’s what
they look like in Pages.</p>

<p>Revealing invisible characters is tremendously helpful, but it can also
clutter up the display and make text harder to read. So every app that
lets you show invisibles also makes it easy to hide them again so you
can focus on your text.</p>

<p>Note that even if you can see invisible characters on the screen, they
will not show in a printout of the document.</p>

<p>Precisely where you find the Show Invisibles command—and what it’s
called—varies from app to app. Here’s where to look in some popular
Mac word processing, page layout, and text editing apps:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Pages:</strong> In Apple’s Pages, you can reveal invisible characters by
choosing View &gt; Show Invisibles. To hide them, choose View &gt; Hide
Invisibles—the command changes based on whether or not they’re
showing.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Microsoft Word:</strong> In Microsoft’s near-ubiquitous word processor,
the primary way you show and hide invisibles is by clicking the
<strong>¶</strong> button in the Home toolbar. Click it once to show and again to
hide. However, if you always want certain invisible characters to
appear, you can select them individually in Word &gt; Preferences &gt;
View &gt; Show Non-Printing Characters.

  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Nisus Writer Pro:</strong> In this highly capable, long-standing
alternative to Microsoft Word, choose View &gt; Show Invisibles. When
selected, it gains a checkmark. Choose it again to conceal the
characters and remove the checkmark.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Scrivener:</strong> In this word processor aimed at long-form writing and
screenwriting, choose View &gt; Text Editing &gt; Show Invisibles.
Choose it again to hide them.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Adobe InDesign:</strong> In Adobe’s market-leading page-layout app,
choose Type &gt; Show Hidden Characters. The command changes when
selected. Hide them again by choosing Type &gt; Hide Hidden
Characters.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Affinity Publisher:</strong> In this inexpensive but surprisingly
full-featured competitor to InDesign, the command you’re looking for
is Text &gt; Show Special Characters. When you choose this command, it
gains a checkmark. Choose it again to hide invisible characters and
remove the checkmark.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>BBEdit:</strong> This text-editing powerhouse aimed at developers,
bloggers, and Web designers lets you show tabs and returns, spaces,
or both. Either choose the Show Invisibles and Show Spaces commands
in View &gt; Text Display or click the tiny gear icon in the upper
left of the window and select the appropriate checkboxes.

  </li>
</ul>

<p>Not all text-focused apps offer a way of displaying these invisible
characters. For instance, we know of no way of doing this in Apple’s
TextEdit. Nor is it possible in the online word processor Google Docs,
although you can achieve a similar effect temporarily by choosing Edit</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Find and Replace, selecting Match Using Regular Expressions, and then
searching (one at a time) for a space, for t for tabs, and for n for
returns.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Even if you’re using an app not mentioned above, our descriptions of
their approaches should give a sense of what to look for in the
interface or the app’s documentation. Enjoy your newfound ability to see
beyond the visible!</p>
