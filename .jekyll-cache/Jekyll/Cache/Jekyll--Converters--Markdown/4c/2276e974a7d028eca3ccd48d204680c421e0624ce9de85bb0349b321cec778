I"´<p>When youâ€™re in the Finder, choosing File &gt; New Finder Window does, as
youâ€™d expect, open a new Finder window. But what folder appears in that
window? By default, new Finder windows open to Recents, which is a
built-in smart folder showing recently opened documents. If youâ€™d prefer
to see items in a fixed location on your drive, go to Finder &gt;
Preferences &gt; General and choose any location from the New Finder
Windows Show pop-up menu. Weâ€™re partial to Desktop or Documents, but you
can choose whatever folder makes sense with your workflow.</p>
