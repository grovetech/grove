I"í<p>We‚Äôre cautious when it comes to recommending upgrades to new versions of
macOS. Apple makes the upgrade process easy‚Äîthough it can be
time-consuming‚Äîbut upgrading can create workflow interruptions, render
favorite apps inoperable, and have other consequences. At the same time,
it‚Äôs important to stay in sight of the cutting edge for security reasons
and to take advantage of advances from Apple and other developers.
Upgrading is not an <em>if</em> question; it‚Äôs a <em>when</em> question.</p>

<p>We‚Äôre not saying that everyone needs to upgrade to <a href="https://www.apple.com/macos/big-sur/">macOS 11 Big
Sur</a> now, but if you want to, it
should be safe now that Apple has released several bug-fix updates.
However, there are still a few caveats, and preparation is essential.‚Äã</p>

<h3 id="reasons-not-to-upgrade">Reasons Not to Upgrade</h3>

<p>Some people should continue to delay upgrades to Big Sur due to software
incompatibilities. Most software under steady development will have been
updated for Big Sur by now, but some workflows rely on older versions of
apps where an upgrade isn‚Äôt practical or possible (ancient versions of
Adobe Creative Suite, for instance), or on obsolete apps that will never
be updated. You may be able to <a href="https://roaringapps.com/apps?platform=osx">learn more at
RoaringApps</a>, but those who
haven‚Äôt yet upgraded past 10.14 Mojave may have to upgrade or replace
32-bit apps that ceased working starting with 10.15 Catalina.</p>

<p>The other app category that continues to have trouble with Big Sur are
backup apps that make bootable duplicates. Catalina moved macOS to its
own read-only volume, and Big Sur goes a step further by applying
cryptographic signatures that make it even harder for an attacker to
compromise the operating system. Unfortunately, that also makes creating
a bootable duplicate difficult. <a href="https://bombich.com/blog/2021/11/03/yes-you-can-have-bootable-backups-on-macos-big-sur">Carbon Copy
Cloner</a>
and
<a href="https://www.econtechnologies.com/chronosync/TN-CS-BigSurBootable.html">ChronoSync</a>
have developed workarounds;
<a href="https://www.shirtpocket.com/blog/index.php/shadedgrey/comments/thats_big_sir_to_you/">SuperDuper</a>
remains incompatible at this point, although an older version can create
data-only backups. If you rely on one of these apps for critical
backups, make sure you know what you‚Äôre getting into before upgrading or

strategy</a>.‚Äã</p>

<h3 id="before-you-upgrade">Before You Upgrade</h3>

<p>Once you‚Äôve decided to upgrade to Big Sur, you have three main tasks:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Update apps:</strong> Make sure all your apps are as up-to-date as
possible. If you regularly put off updates, now‚Äôs the time to let
them complete so you have Big Sur-compatible versions.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Clear space:</strong> Big Sur needs a minimum of 35.5 GB to upgrade, and
as of macOS 11.2.1, the installer won‚Äôt proceed unless there‚Äôs
enough space. Don‚Äôt cut this close‚Äîyou should always have at least
10‚Äì20% free space for virtual memory, cache files, and breathing
room.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Make a backup:</strong> Never, ever install a major upgrade to macOS
without ensuring that you have at least one current backup first. In
an ideal world, you‚Äôd have an updated Time Machine backup, a
bootable duplicate, and an Internet backup. That way, if something
goes wrong as thousands of files are moved around on your drive, you
can easily restore.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>After those tasks are complete, make sure you don‚Äôt need your Mac for a
few hours. There‚Äôs no telling exactly how long the upgrade will take,
especially if it has to convert your drive to APFS, so never start an
upgrade if you need the Mac soon.</p>

<p>Initiating the upgrade is just a matter of opening System Preferences &gt;
Software Update, clicking the Upgrade Now button, and following the
instructions.</p>

<h3 id="after-you-upgrade">After You Upgrade</h3>

<p>Part of the reason to set aside plenty of time for your Big Sur upgrade
is that there are always clean-up tasks afterward. We can‚Äôt predict
precisely what you‚Äôll run into, but here are a few situations we‚Äôve
noticed:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>macOS will probably need to update its authentication situation by
asking for your Apple ID password, your Mac‚Äôs password, and if you
have another Mac, its password too. Don‚Äôt worry that this is a
security breach‚Äîit‚Äôs fine.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Some apps may have to ask for permission to access your contacts and
calendar even though you previously granted permission. Again,
that‚Äôs fine.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If you use your Apple Watch to unlock your Mac and apps (and you
should, it‚Äôs great!), you‚Äôll need to re-enable that in System
Preferences &gt; Security &amp; Privacy &gt; General.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If you use Gmail or Google Calendar or other Google services, you
may need to log in to your Google account again.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Websites that usually remember your login state will likely require
that you log in again. If you‚Äôre using a password manager like
<a href="https://1password.com/">1Password</a>, that‚Äôs easy.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>You may have to re-enable text-message forwarding to your Mac on
your iPhone in Settings &gt; Messages &gt; Text Message Forwarding.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Those who use Backblaze for Internet backups will find their backups
have been ‚Äúsafety frozen.‚Äù <a href="https://help.backblaze.com/hc/en-us/articles/217666178-Safety-Freeze-Your-Backup-is-Safety-Frozen-">Follow these
instructions</a>
for thawing your account.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Finally, Time Machine in Big Sur now <a href="https://support.apple.com/guide/mac-help/types-of-disks-you-can-use-with-time-machine-mh15139/mac">supports and prefers
APFS-formatted
drives</a>,
and all of Apple‚Äôs development is going in that direction now. You can
keep using your existing Time Machine backup in Big Sur, but after
you‚Äôre confident that everything is working well‚Äîand you have another
backup‚Äîit‚Äôs worth removing your Time Machine backup drive in System
Preferences &gt; Time Machine &gt; Select Disk, reformatting the drive as
APFS in Disk Utility, and restarting the backup in the Time Machine
preference pane.</p>
