I"®<p>Have you wondered what you can do with the Wallet app on your iPhone?
Although it started life called Passbook, Apple soon realized that the
only sensible name was Wallet. That‚Äôs because it stores digital versions
of roughly the same sort of things you might put in a physical wallet:
credit and debit cards, store cards, membership cards, and even cash
(well, Apple Pay Cash, anyway).</p>

<p>Nearly all airlines can put your boarding passes in Wallet, too, and if
you buy something like a concert ticket online, you may be able to add
it to Wallet by tapping the ‚ÄúAdd to Apple Wallet‚Äù button in the
confirmation page or email. Having a boarding pass or ticket, which
Apple calls a <em>pass</em>, in Wallet makes it easy to scan for a gate
attendant.</p>

<p>Here‚Äôs how to use cards and passes in Wallet.</p>

<h3 id="display-your-cards-and-passes">Display Your Cards and Passes</h3>

<p>The main Wallet screen shows your cards and passes in a scrollable list,
with credit/debit cards at the top. (If you‚Äôve set up Apple Pay Cash,
it‚Äôs treated as a debit card.)</p>

<p>To view more details about a card or pass, tap it.</p>

<p>In the case of a credit/debit card, you see the face of the card and a
list of its recent Apple Pay transactions.</p>

<p>For boarding passes for multi-flight trips, you see a single pass in the
main list, but after you tap it, you can swipe horizontally to display
the pass for each leg of the trip.</p>

<p>Membership cards, such as the ChargePoint card, may work like
credit/debit cards in that you need to hold them near a reader to sign
in.</p>

<p>In each case, to access settings related to the card or pass, tap the
black ‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢ button at the upper right.</p>

<h3 id="adding-and-using-credit-and-debit-cards">Adding and Using Credit and Debit Cards</h3>

<p>Adding a credit/debit card so it can work with Apple Pay starts with
tapping the black + button at the upper right of the Wallet screen. From
there, follow the prompts‚Äîyou can scan your card with the camera
instead of keying in the data.</p>

<p>If you add more than one card, you‚Äôll want to specify which should be
the default for Apple Pay. Go to Settings &gt; Wallet &amp; Apple Pay. Scroll
down to Transaction Defaults, and tap Default Card. Tap the desired
card. In Wallet, the default card appears with its full face showing,
below your other credit/debit cards.</p>

<p>To pay for a purchase with a stored credit/debit card at a payment
terminal, put your iPhone right next to the terminal. The iPhone may
automatically prompt you to authenticate Apple Pay, but if not,
double-click the Home button or, with the iPhone X, XR, XS, or XS Max,
double-click the side button. Wallet displays your default card. To
authenticate, rest your finger on the Home button or, with the iPhone X
models, authenticate with Face ID. To use a non-default card, tap the
card pile at the bottom of the screen and then tap the desired card.</p>

<h3 id="adding-and-using-airplane-boarding-passes-and-event-tickets">Adding and Using Airplane Boarding Passes and Event Tickets</h3>

<p>For flights, when you check in and get boarding passes using the
airline‚Äôs iPhone app, you‚Äôll be given the opportunity to tap an Add to
Apple Wallet button. Do that and the boarding pass appears in Wallet,
which will also display a notification for it on the Lock screen in the
hours before your flight. When you need to show the boarding pass to
security or the gate attendant, tap that notification to display the
boarding pass with its QR code.</p>

<p>For events, the ticket-seller may display the Add to Apple Wallet button
on the confirmation page of the checkout process or attach the tickets
to your email receipt. In the latter case, open the message in Mail and
tap the attachment to open it, and then tap Add to put it into Wallet.
Later, when you arrive at the venue, open Wallet and display the
ticket‚Äîagain with a QR code‚Äîto gain entry.</p>

<h3 id="deleting-cards-and-passes">Deleting Cards and Passes</h3>

<p>Although you may want to keep some digital tickets for nostalgic
reasons, it‚Äôs best to clean out old items:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>To delete a credit/debit card, tap the card to view it and then tap
the black ‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢ button. Scroll down and tap Remove This Card.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To remove a pass, go to the bottom of the main Wallet screen and tap
Edit Passes. Tap the red delete button for that item, tap the next
Delete or Delete All button, and then tap Done at the upper right.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Using Wallet makes it easier to keep your physical wallet slimmer. It
can take a few minutes to add your cards and passes initially, but it‚Äôs
worth the effort.</p>
