<p>The â€˜Symptomsâ€™ area shows users being able to add symptoms of illnesses
including muscle ache, nausea, appetite change, &amp; dizziness.</p>

<p>Users of the Health App will be able to add symptoms using the Health
app giving you a way to track symptoms that relate to illness.</p>

<p>Users can add details about each of their symptoms building up a log of
their health status, this will prove invaluable when seeing their
doctor.</p>

<p>The App has basic health logging &amp; tracking features currently, the new
symptoms feature is more substantial allowing users to share more
comprehensive health data with their medical providers.</p>

<p>As personal tech becomes more pervasive in the health field expect to
see more of these features in the future, and so long as the data is
kept private these features can only be a good thing for peopleâ€™s health
in the future.</p>
