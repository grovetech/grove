I"o<p>If you own an iMac Pro, or a Mac mini, MacBook Air, or MacBook Pro model
introduced in 2018 or later, your Mac has one of Apple’s T2 security
chips inside. On the whole, having a T2 chip in your Mac is a good
thing, thanks to significantly increased security and other benefits,
but there are some ramifications that you may not realize.​</p>

<p><strong>What Is a T2 Chip?</strong></p>

<p>Let’s step back briefly. In late 2016, Apple introduced the T2’s
predecessor, the T1, in the first Touch Bar–equipped MacBook Pros. The
T1 offered three primary capabilities:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Management of the Touch Bar’s Touch ID
fingerprint sensor and storage of sensitive biometric information</li>
</ul>

<!-- -->

<ul>
  <li>Integration of the System Management
Controller, which is responsible for heat and power management,
battery charging, and sleeping and waking the Mac</li>
  <li>Detection of non-Apple hardware</li>
</ul>

<p>The T2 builds on the T1’s foundation, adding four more important
capabilities:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Real-time encryption and decryption of data on
built-in SSDs</li>
</ul>

<!-- -->

<ul>
  <li>Support for invoking Siri with “Hey Siri”</li>
  <li>Image enhancement for built-in FaceTime HD
cameras</li>
  <li>Optional protection of the Mac’s boot process
to prevent it from starting up with an external drive</li>
</ul>

<p>All these functions become possible because the T1 and T2 are
essentially separate computers inside your Mac, much like the A-series
chips that power iOS devices. They have their own memory and storage,
and run an operating system called bridgeOS that’s based on
watchOS.</p>

<p>Some of these features enhance performance by offloading processing
(like enhancing FaceTime HD and listening for Siri) to a separate chip.
Others increase security by ensuring that they can’t be compromised by
an attack, even if macOS itself has been infiltrated.​</p>

<p><strong>How Does a T2 Chip Increase Your Security?</strong></p>

<p>There are four basic ways that the T2 chip increases security, two of
which apply only to the MacBook Air and MacBook Pro models.​</p>

<p><strong>Secure Boot</strong></p>

<p>The T2 chip ensures that all the components involved in the Mac’s boot
process, including things like firmware, the macOS kernel, and kernel
extensions—can be cryptographically verified by Apple as trusted. That
prevents an attacker from somehow inserting malicious code at boot and
taking over the Mac.</p>

<p>There are two gotchas, however. First, Secure Boot trusts only code
that’s signed by Apple, with one exception: a specific bootloader signed
by Microsoft to enable Windows 10 to work with Apple’s Boot Camp
technology for running Windows on a Mac. That means you can’t boot from
Linux in Boot Camp, for instance.</p>

<p>Second, with Secure Boot in its default settings, you can’t boot from an
external drive at all. That’s great for security but can make
troubleshooting internal drive problems tricky. To control these
settings, Macs with T2 chips have a Startup Security Utility available
in macOS Recovery (boot while holding down Command-R). You can use it to
allow booting from an external drive for troubleshooting reasons and to
turn down security if you need to install an older version of macOS or
install macOS without an Internet connection available.</p>

​</p>

<p><strong>Encrypted Storage</strong></p>

<p>Because the T2 contains both a crypto engine and the SSD controller, it
enables on-the-fly encryption and decryption of all data stored on the
internal SSD. It uses the same technology as FileVault and requires a
password at startup. Macs with internal hard drives and external hard
drives don’t receive the T2’s protection but can still be encrypted via
FileVault.</p>

<p>The big win from the T2 encrypting all stored data is that there’s no
way to decrypt the data without the password—as long as your password
can’t be guessed, there’s no reason to worry about your data if your
MacBook Pro disappears. The potential downside here is that it’s
impossible to recover data from a damaged Mac without the password.</p>

<p>The T2 chip also controls what happens with failed password attempts.
Fourteen tries are allowed without delays, and then tries 15 through 30
are permitted with increasingly long delays (1 hour between tries for
the last three). After that, more attempts are possible, but after 220
total attempts through various approaches, the T2 chip will refuse to
process any requests to decrypt data, rendering it unrecoverable. In
short, <strong>back up your data!</strong>[  ]{.Apple-converted-space}​</p>

<p><strong>Touch ID</strong></p>

<p>The T2 chip manages the Touch Bar’s Touch ID fingerprint sensor that
lets you log in to your MacBook Air or MacBook Pro without entering your
password. Even so, the password is required after turning the Mac on or
restarting, and the Mac also requires the password if you haven’t
unlocked it in 48 hours, if you haven’t provided the password in the
last 156 hours <em>and</em> used your fingerprint [over the previous 4
hours, or if the fingerprint read fails five times.​</p>

<p><strong>Mic Drop</strong></p>

<p>This isn’t exactly related to the T2 chip, but all T2-equipped MacBook
Air and MacBook Pro models feature a hardware disconnect that disables
the microphone whenever the lid is closed. That prevents any software
from turning on the mic and eavesdropping on you. No disconnect is
necessary for the FaceTime HD camera when the lid is closed because its
field of view is completely obstructed in that position.</p>

<p>So there you have it. The T2 chip significantly increases the security
of your Mac, but it comes with tradeoffs that make it harder to boot
from external drives or run other operating
systems.</p>
