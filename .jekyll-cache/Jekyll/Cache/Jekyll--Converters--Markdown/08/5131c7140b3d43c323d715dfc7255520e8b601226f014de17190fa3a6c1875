<p>It has been touted for several years that Apple may start using ARM
processors in their Mac line up. However, in recent months with AMD
releasing more and more powerful Ryzen processors pundits have been
guessing Apple will announce an ARM based Mac at the upcoming Apple
WWDC.</p>

<p><strong>What could this mean for us Mac users and should you hold off on
buying a new Mac?</strong></p>

<p>Well only 15 years ago Apple successfully moved their desktop Mac line
up from PowerPC processors to intel. This was done because Intel based
x86 processors were more powerful &amp; energy efficient than the PowerPC
alternatives and staying with PowerPC was going to hurt the Mac line
up.</p>

<p>The transition from PowerPC to Intel x86 chips such as the Core 2 Duo
was a fairly seamless experience for most users with Apple introducing
Rosetta which allowed your PowerPC based apps to run on your intel Mac
up until MacOS Snow Leopard. Or if you stuck with Leopard it was / is
possible to keep running PowerPC based apps.</p>

<p>Apple moving to its own ARM based chips which already power your iPads
and iPhones may allow Apple to reduce the cost of each Mac or provide
more features for the same money. With AMD launching the Thread Ripper
series of processors it would also allow more powerful Macs to be
released.</p>

<p>In the short term I would imagine if Apple were to release an ARM based
Mac it would be on its own chip and be either a MacBook or a MacBook Air
the MacBook Pro &amp; MacPro would more likely still come with an Intel
processor as standard for several years to come.</p>

<p>With that said if you’re thinking of buying a Mac that isn’t one of
the base models waiting for an ARM version wouldn’t be worth it, even
if Apple does introduce an ARM based Mac they will still continue to
support Intel based Macs for years to come just as they did with PowerPC
based Macs.</p>

<p>Apple may even continue to produce Intel based Macs at the same time as
ARM based Macs, using their own processors in certain Macs would allow
them to save money on the production cost for certain
models.</p>

<p>Obviously, this is all speculation, but with so many people now betting
on Apple releasing an ARM based Mac I wouldn’t be surprised to see one.
It also makes sense for Apple as they make a lot of their own hardware
so why not the CPU for some or all of their desktops.</p>

<p>Stay tuned as we’ll cover any significant items to come from the
virtual WWDC later this month.</p>
