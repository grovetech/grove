<p>Four years after the release of the original iPhone SE, Apple has
introduced <a href="https://www.apple.com/iphone-se/" rel="nofollow">a second-generation iPhone
SE</a> with aggressive
pricing that starts at just $399. Whereas the original model used the
svelte, easy-to-hold iPhone 5s case design with a 4-inch screen, this
new iPhone SE repurposes the larger iPhone 8 design with its 4.7-inch
screen. But Apple didnâ€™t just rebrand the iPhone 8. The new iPhone SE
sports several important updates that make it a compelling purchase for
the price, including a new processor and eSIM
capability.</p>

<p>Most notably, Apple upgraded the iPhone 8â€™s A11 Bionic chip to the
faster, more capable A13 Bionic chip that powers the latest iPhone 11
and iPhone 11 Pro models. Apart from pure speed, the A13 Bionic provides
additional computational photography capabilities. Even though the
iPhone SE has only a single rear-facing camera, unlike the multiple
cameras on the backs of the iPhone 11 models, it still supports iOS 13â€™s
Portrait mode and all six Portrait Lighting effects. The A13 Bionic will
also likely increase the quality of iPhone SE photos beyond what the
iPhone 8 could do with the same physical camera.</p>

<p>There are two additional changes of note from the iPhone 8, one good,
one less so. On the positive side, Apple added eSIM capability, which
makes it possible for an iPhone SE to support two cell numbers, each
with its own carrier and plan. Thatâ€™s primarily helpful for those who
frequently travel overseas. Less welcome is the switch from the
pressure-sensitive 3D Touch to Haptic Touch, which simply registers long
presses with haptic feedback. But all of Appleâ€™s 2019 iPhone models
moved to Haptic Touch, and iOS 13 supports Haptic Touch well, so itâ€™s
not much of a loss.</p>

<p>Other <a href="https://www.apple.com/iphone-se/specs/" rel="nofollow">important
specs</a> from the
iPhone 8 that remain unchanged include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Touch ID:</strong> The new iPhone SE continues to rely on the classic
Touch ID sensor embedded in the Home button for unlocking and
authenticating. In a time when we may be wearing masks a lot, Touch
ID may be more welcome than Face ID.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>4.7-inch display:</strong> The iPhone SEâ€™s screen is smaller than the
6.1-inch and 5.8-inch screens in the iPhone 11 and iPhone 11 Pro.
But itâ€™s still a Retina HD screen with True Toneâ€”few people will
notice much of a difference in quality.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Cameras:</strong> The iPhone SEâ€™s rear-facing camera has a 12-megapixel
sensor with optical image stabilization, and it can record 4K video
at up to 60 frames per second. The front-facing camera is 7
megapixels and supports 1080p video at 30 fps.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Battery life and charging:</strong> Battery life should be similar to
that of the iPhone 8, so you should be able to go all day on a
charge. If you do need to top up, the iPhone SE supports fast
charging, and itâ€™s also compatible with Qi wireless charging pads.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>What makes this second-generation iPhone SE compelling is its pricing.
For a 64 GB model, the price is $399. 128 GB costs $449, and 256 GB is
$549. In comparison, youâ€™d pay $200 more for 2018â€™s iPhone XR, $300
more for the current iPhone 11, and $600 more for todayâ€™s iPhone 11
Pro. Those phones may have Face ID and take better photos, but itâ€™s
great that Apple is finally offering a budget-friendly iPhone once
again.</p>

<p>Some people will be disappointed with the size of the new iPhone SE.
Yes, itâ€™s a lot smaller than the iPhone 11, and a bit more
pocket-friendly than the iPhone 11 Pro, but itâ€™s significantly beefier
than the original iPhone SE. If you were hoping that Apple would bring
back an iPhone for those with smaller hands and smaller pockets, sorry.</p>

<p>The new iPhone SE will be available for pre-order starting on Friday,
April 17th, with deliveries and store availability starting a week later
on April 24th. For the body color, you can choose black or white, or you
can go for the bright red
<a href="https://www.apple.com/product-red/" rel="nofollow">PRODUCT(RED)</a>
version, the proceeds from which will go to help the Global Fundâ€™s
COVID-19 Response through September 30th.</p>
