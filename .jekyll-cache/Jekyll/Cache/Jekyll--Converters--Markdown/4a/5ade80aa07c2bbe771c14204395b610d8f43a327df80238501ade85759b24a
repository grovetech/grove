I"]<p>If you’re flying, driving, or biking to visit an iPhone-using friend or
family member, you can reduce anxiety related to arrival time or pickup
plans (and perhaps provide amusement) by sharing your location
temporarily so they can watch your progress. The easiest way to do this
is to go into a Messages conversation with that person on your iPhone,
tap their picture at the top, tap the i button that appears, tap Share
My Location, and then tap either Share for One Hour or Share Until End
of Day, whichever is appropriate for the length of your trip. They can
then see where you are by going into the same Messages conversation,
tapping your name, and then tapping the i button. And, of course, if
you’re coordinating an airport pickup, it’s a help if the other person
shares their location with you too!</p>
