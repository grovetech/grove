I"Ÿ<p>Most Mac users rely on iPhones and iPads to take photos and store them
in the Photos app, which happens automatically for those who use Appleâ€™s
iCloud Photos syncing service. But what if you want to import photos
from a device other than an iPhone or iPadâ€”say a Samsung smartphone
running Androidâ€”and what if you donâ€™t want those images in Photos?
Turn to Appleâ€™s Image Capture app, which has shipped with macOS for ages
and is stored in your Applications folderâ€™s Utilities folder. To use it,
connect your device to your Mac via USB, launch Image Capture, and click
the device in the sidebar. Choose a destination from the Import To
pop-up menu, and then either select some photos and click Import or
click the Import All button to get everything.</p>
