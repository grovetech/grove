<p>We’ve been seeing a spate of bulging batteries of late, both in Mac
laptops and iPhones. A bulging battery is a Very Bad Thing™ and must be
dealt with immediately because it could catch fire or even explode. As
lithium-ion batteries age, the chemical reactions that produce power no
longer complete fully, resulting in the creation of gasses that can
cause the battery to swell. Additionally, manufacturing errors or damage
to the membranes that separate the internal layers of the battery can
also lead to swelling.</p>

<h3 id="what-to-look-for">What to Look For</h3>

<p>With Mac laptops, a variety of problems—some rather subtle—can
indicate that the internal battery is swelling, including the screen not
closing properly, a gap between the upper and lower parts of the case, a
failure to sit perfectly flat, problems clicking the trackpad, or
keyboard keys malfunctioning.</p>

<p>With an iPhone or iPad, a swollen battery is usually obvious because it
starts to warp the case and can even crack the screen—it all depends
on where the swelling takes place and what part of the device gives way
first.</p>

<h3 id="what-to-do">What to Do</h3>

<p>When you discover a bulging battery, unplug the device immediately and
turn it off as soon as you can. Continued charging or use could lead to
a fire or explosion. However, if the device is still functional and you
need to copy data off or let a final backup run, try to put it in a
place where it’s less likely to cause problems—on a concrete, stone,
or tile surface, for instance, and preferably outside as long as it’s
not wet, hot, or in the sun.</p>

<p>In some cases, as with older MacBooks, it’s relatively easy to
disassemble the case and remove the battery. If you feel comfortable
doing that, you may be able to reduce the chances of further damage.
It’s much harder to work on iPhones and iPads.</p>

<p>Make sure you’re somewhere well-ventilated and safe, with easy access to
outside and preferably a foam-based fire extinguisher at hand. If a fire
does start, water will also put it out—make sure to have plenty on
hand. Be sure to wear eye protection and gloves. Also, make sure you
have somewhere safe to store the battery once removed, such as a metal
can with a lid or with sand in it. Finally, be super careful around the
battery, and whatever you do, do not puncture the swollen cell—some of
the gases could be harmful.</p>

<p>Once you’ve removed the battery from the device, you must take it
somewhere for recycling. Under no circumstances should you send it via
the mail or put it in the regular garbage. Although various
companies—including Apple, Best Buy, Home Depot, and Lowes—recycle
batteries, call your local store first to see if they take swollen
batteries (they may not be equipped to do so safely). Better yet, check
with your county or municipality to see where you should take hazardous
waste.</p>

<h3 id="getting-your-device-fixed">Getting Your Device Fixed</h3>

<p>The best-case scenario is that you have AppleCare+ on the device such
that Apple will fix it for you. However, that’s a bit unlikely because
batteries usually bulge only on older devices. Regardless of AppleCare
status, Apple offers <a href="https://www.apple.com/batteries/service-and-recycling/">battery service and
recycling</a>,
and if you have an <a href="https://www.apple.com/batteries/service-and-recycling/">Apple
Store</a> or
<a href="https://locate.apple.com/">Apple Authorized Service Provider</a>
nearby, that’s a good option. Independent repair shops can also likely
do this work; make sure they have plenty of experience with your device
and offer a warranty for their parts and labor.</p>

<p>Although it’s possible to replace batteries yourself—refer to the
<a href="https://www.ifixit.com/">iFixit</a> site for instructions and links
to replacement batteries—it can be finicky work, particularly in
iPhones and iPads, and you may not save that much money in the end.</p>

<p>Sadly, particularly with an older iPhone, the damage from the bulging
battery may prevent a repair from being worthwhile. The iPhone X
pictured above still worked fine even though the swollen battery broke
its screen, but it wasn’t worth the money to replace the battery and the
screen for a 4-year-old iPhone. In such cases, recycle the entire unit
with the appropriate hazardous waste facility.</p>
