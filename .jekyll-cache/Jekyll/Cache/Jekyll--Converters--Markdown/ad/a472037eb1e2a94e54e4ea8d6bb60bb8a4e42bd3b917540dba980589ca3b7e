I"ƒ<p>If like us you are itching to get into your local Apple store to check
out the latest offerings from our favourite tech company you may be in
for a wait.</p>

<p>Apple said on the 13th of March it was closing all retail stores not
in China as a result of Covid-19.</p>

<p>As of today the 13th of May Apple are reopening in certain countries
&amp; states in a phased reopening plan.</p>

<p>Apple has opened its stores in China and is reopening stores in other
countries throughout Asia Pacific, this includes countries like
Australia and South Korea. Some European countries Such as Germany and
Switzerland are reopening.</p>

<p>Meanwhile here in the USA Apple are reopening in certain states such as
South Carolina &amp; Alabama. You can see the list of Apple stores 
<a href="https://www.apple.com/retail/storelist/" rel="nofollow">here</a>
which will also tell you if your particular store is open and what
times.</p>

<p>For example Apple Washington Square, Tigard OREGON is closed still due
to the Coronavirus (covid-19):</p>

<p>Extra measures are being taken by Apple to protect their store
employees and us the customers; do check for any specific information
about your specific <a href="https://www.apple.com/retail/storelist/" rel="nofollow">Apple store before visiting</a>. On Apple‚Äôs website they make
the following statement when visiting the store:</p>

<p>‚ÄúWe are open again. That means everything you love, including our
products, services, Geniuses and Specialists. For everyone‚Äôs safety,
we‚Äôre following social distancing measures, so you may have to wait in
line before entering. Please also wear a face covering while you are in
the store. If you need one, just ask. See you soon. Check store hours
below. Shop¬†<a href="https://www.apple.com/shop" rel="nofollow">online</a>¬†for free,
no-contact delivery.
Visit¬†<a href="https://support.apple.com/" rel="nofollow">support</a>¬†for product
help.‚Äù</p>

<p>The stores reopening is great but remember it is still not business as
usual &amp; as far as possible, Apple is recommending people avoid the
retail stores you can see what ‚Äúcontactless support‚Äù is available from
Apple here: <a href="https://www.apple.com/shop" rel="nofollow">https://www.apple.com/shop</a></p>

<p>Hopefully this won‚Äôt see a change in the Apple stores as they have been
a real differentiator between Apple and other tech companies in recent
years being able to get your favourite Apple tech fixed locally and
quickly in store.</p>

<p>Of course don‚Äôt forget to check in with your local independent Apple
retailer as in Apple's dark years in the mid to late 90‚Äôs they were
part of what helped keep the Apple brand relevant. Most local stores are
updating information on their websites and social media profiles so you
can check there or get their telephone numbers to check if they are open
to help and what restrictions are in place when you visit.</p>

<p>Don‚Äôt forget here at <a href="https://grovetech.co/products/hosted/fleet/">Grove Technologies</a> we are open for remote and
contactless Apple support as usual.</p>
