I"ã<p>In macOS 11 Big Sur, Apple went back to a design direction from the
earliest days of Mac OS X: a translucent menu bar. Since its color
changes depending on the desktop picture, many people arenâ€™t enamored of
it (left, below). Luckily, reverting to the traditional opaque menu bar
is simple. Open System Preferences &gt; Accessibility &gt; Display and
select Reduce Transparency. That will turn the menu bar gray again and
make other windows and menus opaque, too (right, below). Simple gray
might not be as whizzy as fancy transparency, but itâ€™s more predictable
and easier to see.</p>
