I"»<p>I have long been a fan of WordPress and not so much a fan of the search engine functionality that comes boxed with it. As an Apple Systems Admin I have several WordPress websites running on several OSX Servers. One of the sites that I administer finally got to the size to where the search capabilities of WordPress fell short of the clients desire and I was forced to look into other avenues for searching. I came across, solar. Solr is an open source enterprise search server based on the Lucene Java search library, with XML/HTTP and JSON APIs, hit highlighting, faceted search, caching, replication, and a web administration interface. This looked extremely promising however getting all of the information that I needed in order to get this running on my servers proved to be a cumbersome process, so I am now writing this to consolidate all of the steps and information that I learned while installing and getting Solr to run on our servers.</p>
