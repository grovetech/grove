I"ß<p>If your a fan and a user of MUNKI then you know what a great product it is and what community is behind it. Its backed by some of the largest companies around *(Disney, Google, etc..) and has consistently worked with all versions of OSX that have been around since Munki was created. The Munki client and admin tools requires Python 2.5 or higher with Objective-C Python bindings, which is included by default in Mac OS X. Munki is supported on Leopard through Mavericks.</p>
