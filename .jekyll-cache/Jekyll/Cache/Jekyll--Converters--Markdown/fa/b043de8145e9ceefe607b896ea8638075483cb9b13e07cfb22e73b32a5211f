I"¤<p>This year Apple reached a valuation of $2 Trillion which is both an
achievement and a curse at the same time. Now scrutiny from government
organisations is likely as to where the extraordinary revenue is coming
from.</p>

<p>Already Spotify has issued a complaint in Europe alleging the 30% cut
Apple takes from all sales via the App Store is uncompetitive as the
Apple Music service is not subject to the same 30% tariff, this
complaint has legs, as it was the European commission that ended
Internet Explorerâ€™s monopoly of the web browser market on Windows PCâ€™s
by forcing Microsoft to include a browser choice screen and applying
fines totalling over $1billion USD!</p>

<p>Then we have the high-profile Battle Royale between Apple and
Fortniteâ€™s developer Epic Games, In August of 2020 Apple banned Epic
games from the App store as Epic were encouraging players of Fortnite to
make purchases outside of the App store which goes against Appleâ€™s T&amp;Câ€™s
for publishers in the App store.</p>

<p>Epic wasted no time in filing an anti-competitive lawsuit against
Apple, claiming Apple was curtailing the freedom of smartphone owners.
Apple tried to make Epicâ€™s life harder by issuing further sanctions
relating to the use of Appleâ€™s developer tools; this was however blocked
by the Judge overseeing Epicâ€™s lawsuit against Apple, this did not
affect the App store ban Apple issued against Epic.</p>

<p>Epic itself has been accused of anti-competitive practices in its own
Epic games store making developers agree to less than favourable terms
in order to add their content to the Epic games store.</p>

<p>Throughout all of this Apple claims it is trying to create a level
playing field for developers as they all agree to the same rules,
However Epic and others claim this is not the case with services such as
Amazon Prime Video taking payments directly via the Amazon Prime Video
App.</p>

<p>Epic is currently trying to pull together a coalition of Apple critics
to fight against the App store policies.</p>

<p><strong>What could this mean for our favourite tech company?</strong></p>

<p>It is possible that the European commission and US judicial authorities
proceed with the anti-trust claims against Apple.</p>

<p>The easiest way around this for Apple would be to allow a 3^rd^ party
App Store on iOS and MacOS devices. I would think something akin to the
Browser choice splash screen Microsoft introduced allowing people to
choose whether to install an additional 3^rd^ party App store alongside
the Apple App store.</p>

<p>The arguments against this all boil down to user safety, the current
Apple App store is very strict about what Apps are allowed to do in
regards to collecting user data and what information &amp; devices (such as
the microphone &amp; camera) Apps are allowed to access.</p>

<p>My suggestion would be a splash screen informing users about their
right to use a 3^rd^ party App store which would allow for example
content 18+ and from developers that are not prepared to pay the 30%
commission to Apple while making it crystal clear these 3^rd^ party App
stores do not provide the same level of protection.</p>

<p>Personally I am skilled enough to know how to Jailbreak an iPhone
giving me complete control of the device, however for my day to day
iPhone/iPad &amp; Mac I use the stock App store provided by Apple, I donâ€™t
interfere with the core services of the device as I just want it to
workâ€¦ Thatâ€™s why I use Apple devices.</p>

<p>And so, I do not think a 3^rd^ party App store choice would hurt
Appleâ€™s revenue that much so long as it was made very clear the 3^rd^
party App store may make your device behave in unexpected ways and or
compromise the security of your data.</p>
