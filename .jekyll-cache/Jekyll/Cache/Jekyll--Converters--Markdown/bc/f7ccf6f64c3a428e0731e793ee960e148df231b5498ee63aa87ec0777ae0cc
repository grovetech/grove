I"Ü<p>Most Apple Watch users charge their watch every night, putting it on a
charger as part of a bedtime routine. If thatâ€™s you, make sure youâ€™re
not missing one of the Apple Watchâ€™s best features: nightstand mode.
When you enable it in the iPhoneâ€™s Watch app, in General &gt; Nightstand
Mode, a charging Apple Watch displays the charging status, current time
and date (in a large, easily readable font), and the time of any alarm
youâ€™ve set. It uses a green color that wonâ€™t shock your eyes in the
middle of the night, and after a minute, the screen goes completely
dark. To see it again, tap the watch orâ€”even better!â€”the surface
itâ€™s on. The screen lights up for 10 seconds before going dark again.
(And yes, we love the little <a href="https://www.elago.com/w-stand_apple-watch/w3-stand-white">classic Mac
stand</a>.)</p>
