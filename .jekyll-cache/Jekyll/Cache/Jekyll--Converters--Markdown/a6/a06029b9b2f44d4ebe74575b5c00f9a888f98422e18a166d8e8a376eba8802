<p>Backing up your Mac is like flossing your teeth: everyone knows they should do it every night, but too many people never get around to it. Unlike flossing, once you set up backups, they don’t require daily attention. And turning on Apple’s Time Machine backup feature is easy—simply open System Preferences &gt; Time Machine, click Select Backup Disk, and pick a hard drive to hold your backups.</p>
