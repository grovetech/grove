I"+'<p>We’ve long recommended that everyone use a password manager like
<a href="https://1password.com/">1Password</a> instead of attempting to memorize or
write down passwords. Although there are other password managers,
1Password is the leading solution for Apple users, thanks to a focus on
macOS and iOS from its earliest days.</p>

<p>1Password offers numerous benefits, including:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Automatic generation of strong passwords so you don’t have to invent them</li>
  <li>Secure storage of passwords, even if your Mac or iPhone were stolen</li>
  <li>Automatic entry of usernames and passwords that’s much easier than manual entry</li>
  <li>Auditing of existing accounts to see how many use the same password</li>
  <li>Easy access to all your passwords from all your devices (Mac, iOS, Windows, Android)</li>
  <li>Sharing of passwords among a family or a workgroup</li>
</ul>

<p>The hardest part of getting started with 1Password, like any password
manager, is overcoming the inertia of trying something new. Here’s what
you’ll need to do.​</p>

<h3 id="1-sign-up-for-a-1password-account">1: Sign Up for a 1Password Account</h3>

<p>In this step, you’ll decide which 1Password plan is most appropriate.
For individuals, <a href="https://1password.com/sign-up/">1Password</a> costs
$2.99 per month, or <a href="https://1password.com/families/">1Password
Families</a> is $4.99 per month for a
family of five. For businesses, <a href="https://1password.com/teams/">1Password
Teams</a> adds features and admin controls
for $3.99 per user per month, or <a href="https://1password.com/business/">1Password
Business</a> provides significantly more
admin controls for $7.99 per user per month. You can <a href="https://1password.com/sign-up/">compare the
individual and family accounts</a>, along
with the <a href="https://1password.com/teams/pricing/">Teams and Business
plans</a>, but if you’re still unsure
which to pick, ask us for help.</p>

<p>Once you’ve decided on a plan, click through to the associated page
linked above and sign up. Of course, if your family or business already
uses 1Password, the person who created the account should invite you
first.</p>

<p>Make sure to create a master password that’s strong yet easily typed
because you’ll need to enter it regularly (or use Touch ID, Face ID, or
an Apple Watch) to unlock 1Password. Since you’re putting all sorts of
valuable eggs in your 1Password basket, be sure to download and fill out
your <a href="https://support.1password.com/emergency-kit/">Emergency Kit</a> in
case something happens to you. It also contains the QR code that makes
it easy to sign in on new devices.</p>

<h3 id="2-install-the-1password-apps-and-extensions">2: Install the 1Password Apps and Extensions</h3>

<p>Next, install the 1Password app on each of your devices and connect it
to your 1Password account. <a href="https://support.1password.com/get-the-apps/">1Password provides
instructions</a> for each, but
in short:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Mac:</strong>
    <blockquote>
      <p><a href="https://1password.com/downloads/mac/">Download and install the app</a>, sign in to your
1Password account in your Web browser, click your name at the top
right, and choose Get the Apps. Click “Add your account directly,”
and let your browser open 1Password. Enter your master password
and click Sign In.</p>
    </blockquote>
  </li>
  <li><strong>iPhone/iPad:</strong>
    <blockquote>
      <p><a href="https://apps.apple.com/app/id568903335">Download and open the app</a>, and tap
1Password.com &gt; Scan Setup Code. Then <a href="https://support.1password.com/secret-key/">find the Setup
Code</a> ➊ and scan it
using the camera. Enter your master password and tap Done. Next,
go to Settings &gt; Passwords &gt; AutoFill Passwords, enable AutoFill
Passwords ➋, select 1Password ➌, and deselect Keychain.

    </blockquote>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Web Browser:</strong> The 1Password X extension makes it easier to sign
    <blockquote>
      <p>in to sites using Safari, <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/1password-x-–-password-ma/aeblfdkhhhdcdjpifhhbdiojplfjncoa">Google Chrome</a>,
<a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/1password-x-password-manager/">Firefox</a>,
<a href="https://microsoftedge.microsoft.com/addons/detail/dppgmdbiimibapkepcbdbmkaabgiofem">Microsoft
Edge</a>,
and
<a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/1password-x-–-password-ma/aeblfdkhhhdcdjpifhhbdiojplfjncoa">Brave</a>.
The 1Password app installs the Safari extension for you; the rest
you’ll need to get manually.</p>
    </blockquote>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>With any security solution, there’s a tradeoff between ease of use and
security. 1Password provides options so you can adjust that tradeoff to
your liking.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Mac:</strong> In 1Password &gt; Preferences &gt; Security, you can enable
    <blockquote>
      <p><a href="https://support.1password.com/apple-watch-mac/">unlock using an Apple Watch</a> if you have
both an Apple Watch and a Mac with a Secure Enclave. Also, set the
various Auto-Lock checkboxes as you desire—if your Mac is in a
shared space, err on the side of more security; if only you and
trusted people can access it, you can be less strict.

    </blockquote>
  </li>
  <li><strong>iPhone/iPad:</strong> Tap the Settings button, then Security, and enable
    <blockquote>
      <p>Touch ID or Face ID. They let you avoid entering your master
password to access 1Passsord while maintaining a high level of
security.

    </blockquote>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="3-save-and-fill-passwords">3: Save and Fill Passwords</h3>

<p>Now it’s time to start using 1Password. The first thing you’ll need to
do is save your website logins as you go—you’ll need to do this only
once per site. Again, 1Password provides instructions for both the
<a href="https://support.1password.com/save-fill-passwords/">Mac</a> and the
<a href="https://support.1password.com/ios-autofill/">iPhone or iPad</a>, but
here’s a summary:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Mac:</strong> Whenever you enter your username and password in a Web
    <blockquote>
      <p>login form, 1Password will ask you to save your credentials. Click
the Save In 1Password button and edit the title of the login
button if desired. If you don’t yet have an account at the site,
enter your username, click the 1Password icon in the password
field, and choose Use Selected Password to accept the strong
password 1Password has generated for you. Finally, click Save.
<img alt="Blog Photo" src="https://grovetech.co/assets/img/blog/2020/20210202Ge/image7.png" class="img-fluid rounded m-2" width="400" /></p>
    </blockquote>
  </li>
  <li><strong>iPhone/iPad:</strong> When you tap a username or password field, either
    <blockquote>
      <p>in an app or in a website in Safari, the iOS keyboard will appear.
Tap the key icon ➊, and then tap Create Login ➋. Enter your
credentials. If you don’t yet have an account at the site, enter
your desired username ➌ and tap the gear icon ➍ to generate a
strong password. Finally, tap Save &amp; Fill ➎.
<img alt="Blog Photo" src="https://grovetech.co/assets/img/blog/2020/20210202Ge/image8.jpeg" class="img-fluid rounded m-2" width="400" /></p>
    </blockquote>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>With logins saved in 1Password, when you want to sign in to one of those
sites in the future, it has just become extremely easy.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Mac #1:</strong> If you’re already looking at a website’s login fields,
    <blockquote>
      <p>click the 1Password button in a username or password field and
then choose the login you want to fill.
<img alt="Blog Photo" src="https://grovetech.co/assets/img/blog/2020/20210202Ge/image9.png" class="img-fluid rounded m-2" width="400" /></p>
    </blockquote>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Mac #2:</strong> Alternatively, click the 1Password button in the
    <blockquote>
      <p>browser’s toolbar. If 1Password’s suggestions aren’t right, type a
few characters from the site name in the Search field. Click the
AutoFill button for the desired result to load that site and
auto-fill your credentials.
<img alt="Blog Photo" src="https://grovetech.co/assets/img/blog/2020/20210202Ge/image10.png" class="img-fluid rounded m-2" width="400" /></p>
    </blockquote>
  </li>
  <li><strong>iPhone/iPad:</strong> Tap a username ➊ or password field in an app or Web
    <blockquote>
      <p>page. Your username appears above the keyboard; tap it to fill in
the username and password and tap Go if necessary. If you have
multiple logins at that site, tap the key icon ➋ to choose a
different one ➌.

    </blockquote>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>We’ve just scratched the surface of what 1Password can do. If you
explore the <a href="https://support.1password.com/">1Password support site</a>,
you can learn how to enter two-factor authentication codes (1Password
calls them one-time passwords) automatically, create and share vaults
with others, add and auto-fill credit card information, and use the
Watchtower feature to see which of your logins use weak or duplicate
passwords.</p>
