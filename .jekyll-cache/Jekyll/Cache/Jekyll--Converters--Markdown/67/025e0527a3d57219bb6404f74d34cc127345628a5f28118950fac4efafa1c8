I"Þ<p>Sharing your location works well when youâ€™re out with friends or family
and want everyone to be able to see where everyone else is. Itâ€™s easy to
enable in various spots in iOS 13â€”in Messages, in Contacts, in the
Find My app, and so on. You can share your location for an hour, until
the end of the day, or indefinitely, but beware of this final option. If
youâ€™re with a group for a weeklong trip, for instance, sharing
indefinitely makes sense, but itâ€™s easy to forget to turn it off, at
which point those people can see where you are at all times. We
recommend that you periodically audit the list of people with whom
youâ€™ve shared your location. To do so in iOS 13, open the Find My app,
tap the People button in the bottom toolbar, and look through the list.
For anyone you want to delete, swipe left on their name and tap the
trash button.</p>
