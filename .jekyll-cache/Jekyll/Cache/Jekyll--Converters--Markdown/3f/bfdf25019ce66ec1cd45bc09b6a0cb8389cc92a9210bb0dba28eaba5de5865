I"\<p>If you’re using QuickBooks Online with the service’s Mac app to manage
your business’s accounting, you may have seen a message like the one
below announcing that Intuit has <a href="https://quickbooks.intuit.com/online/apps/">stopped updating the QuickBooks Online
app</a>. This doesn’t affect
your QuickBooks Online account, which you can and should use via a Web
browser at qbo.intuit.com now. Even if the QuickBooks Online Mac app
continues to work, which it likely will for some time, we recommend that
you delete it and switch entirely to a Web browser. It’s not safe to use
an unsupported app for financial records because Intuit won’t be fixing
any security vulnerabilities going forward.</p>
