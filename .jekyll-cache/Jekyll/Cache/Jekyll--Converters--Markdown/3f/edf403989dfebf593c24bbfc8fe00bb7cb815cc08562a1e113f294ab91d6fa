I"Ç<p>Over the last decade, and particularly during the last year of pandemic
life, documents have become more likely to arrive in email or as
downloads than on paper. If you need to return a signed document on
paper, itâ€™s easy to print and sign it before popping it in the mailbox.
But what if you need to send it back via email or another online method?
You could print, sign, scan, and return the scanned document, but thatâ€™s
both tedious and wasteful.</p>

<p>Happily, Apple has made it easy to digitize your signature such that you
can quickly apply it to digital documents without them ever hitting
paper. Itâ€™s not difficult to set up, and once your signature is in the
system, it remains available for repeated use. Even better, it syncs
automatically to all your other Apple devices signed in to the same
iCloud account, so itâ€™s available wherever you need it. The process
varies a little depending on which Apple devices you have available.â€‹</p>

<p>You can create a signature on an iPad or iPhone with your finger or a
rubber-tipped stylus, but youâ€™ll get the best results with an Apple
Pencil on an iPad. Follow these steps:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Open any PDF in any app, such as this <a href="https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/f1040.pdf">IRS Form
1040</a> in Safari.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Tap the share icon and tap Markup in the share sheet.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the Markup toolbar, tap + and then Signature.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Tap Add or Remove Signature and then tap + to add a signature.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the New Signature panel, sign your name. (You can rotate an
iPhone to landscape orientation if thatâ€™s easier.)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If you donâ€™t like your signature, tap Clear and try again.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When you have a good signature, tap Done.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Close the PDFâ€”thereâ€™s no need to save it.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<h3 id="create-your-signature-on-a-mac">Create Your Signature on a Mac</h3>

<p>On a Mac, you create signatures in Preview in one of several different
ways. Youâ€™ll get the best results from using the camera to scan your
signature on a piece of paper, with an iPad and Apple Pencil as the next
best. The trackpad approach is the least successful.</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Open any PDF in Preview, such as the aforementioned <a href="https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/f1040.pdf">IRS Form
1040</a>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Choose Tools &gt; Annotate &gt; Signature &gt; Manage Signatures. (You can
also click the Signatures button on the Markup toolbar.)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Click Create Signature.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Click Trackpad, Camera, or iPhone or iPad to create your signature:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <p><strong>Trackpad:</strong> Click the Click Here to Begin button and sign your
name with your finger or a rubber-tipped stylusâ€”after you
click, lift your finger or stylus and start writing your
signature at the left side of the trackpad. Press any key on the
keyboard when youâ€™re done, or click Clear and try again if
necessary. (Tip: press any key to start and clear too.)</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><strong>Camera:</strong> Sign your name with a black pen on a white piece of
paper. Hold it up to the camera, just above the blue line, for
automatic recognition. If necessary, click Clear and try again.
For best results, use a full-size piece of paper and a fairly
thick pen, like a Sharpie.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><strong>iPhone or iPad:</strong> Click Select Device and pick an available
iPhone or iPad. The entire screen of the device becomes a
signing surfaceâ€”you can use whichever orientation is easier.
Sign your name using your finger, a rubber-tipped stylus, or for
best results, an Apple Pencil on an iPad. Tap Clear if you need
to try again.

      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When youâ€™re finished, click Done.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Close the PDF.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>Although most of us have only one signature, Apple lets you create and
sync as many signatures as you like. That could be useful if you have to
sign documents for your boss or a member of your family (with their
permission, of course).</p>

<p>Once youâ€™ve digitized your signature, you can add it to any PDF form
that you receive, either using Markup from an iPhone or iPad share
sheet, or in Preview or the Markup tools on a Mac.</p>
