I"ã<p>There‚Äôs an Internet saying: ‚ÄúIf you‚Äôre not the customer, you‚Äôre the product.‚Äù The point is that, if you‚Äôre getting a service for free, the company providing it sees you not as a customer, but as a product to sell, generally to advertisers.</p>

<p>This is how Google, Facebook, and Twitter operate. They provide services for free, collect data about you, and make money by showing you ads. In theory, the more that advertisers know about you, the better they can target ads to you, and the more likely you‚Äôll be to buy. Personalized advertising can seem creepy (or clueless, when it fails), but it isn‚Äôt inherently evil, and we‚Äôre not suggesting that you stop using ad-supported services.</p>

<p>This ad-driven approach stands in stark contrast to how Apple does business. Apple makes most of its money by selling hardware‚ÄîiPhones, Macs, and iPads, primarily. Another big chunk of Apple‚Äôs revenue comes from App Store and iTunes Store sales, iCloud subscriptions, and Apple Pay fees. Knowing more about you, what Web pages you visit, what you buy, and who you‚Äôre friends with doesn‚Äôt help Apple‚Äôs business, and on its <a href="https://www.apple.com/privacy/">Privacy</a> page, Apple says bluntly, ‚ÄúWe believe privacy is a fundamental human right.‚Äù</p>

<p>Of course, once your data is out there, it can be lost or stolen‚Äîin June 2018, a security researcher discovered that the online data broker <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/exactis-database-leak-340-million-records/">Exactis was exposing a database containing 340 million records of data</a> on hundreds of millions of American adults. Ouch!</p>

<p>Let‚Äôs look at a few of the ways that Apple protects your privacy.</p>

<h3 id="siri-and-dictation">Siri and Dictation</h3>
<hr />
<p>The longer you use Siri and Dictation, the better they work, thanks to your devices transmitting data back to Apple for analysis. However, Apple creates a random identifier for your data rather than associating the information with your Apple ID, and if you reset Siri by turning it off and back on, you‚Äôll get a new random identifier. Whenever possible, Apple keeps Siri functionality on your device, so if you search for a photo by location or get suggestions after a search, those results come from local data only.</p>

<h3 id="touch-id-and-face-id">Touch ID and Face ID</h3>
<hr />
<p>When you register your fingerprints with Touch ID or train Face ID to recognize your face, it‚Äôs reasonable to worry about that information being stored where attackers‚Äîor some government agency‚Äîcould access it and use it for nefarious purposes. Apple was concerned about that too, so these systems don‚Äôt store images of your fingerprints or face, but instead mathematical signatures based on them. Those signatures are kept only locally, in the Secure Enclave security coprocessor that‚Äôs part of the CPU of the iPhone and iPad‚Äîand on Touch ID-equipped laptops‚Äîin such a way that the images can‚Äôt be reverse engineered from the signatures.</p>

<p>And, of course, a major goal of Touch ID and Face ID is to prevent someone from violating your privacy by accessing your device directly.</p>

<h3 id="health-and-fitness">Health and Fitness</h3>
<hr />
<p>People with medical conditions can be concerned about health information impacting health insurance bills or a potential employer‚Äôs hiring decision. To assuage that worry, Apple lets you choose what information ends up in Health app, and once it‚Äôs there, encrypts it whenever your iPhone is locked. Plus, any Health data that‚Äôs backed up to iCloud is encrypted both in transit and when it‚Äôs stored on Apple‚Äôs servers.</p>

<h3 id="app-store-guidelines">App Store Guidelines</h3>
<hr />
<p>A linchpin in Apple‚Äôs approach to privacy is its control over the App Store. Since developers must submit apps to Apple for approval, Apple can enforce stringent guidelines that specify how apps can ask for access to your data (location, photos, contacts, etc). This isn‚Äôt a blanket protection‚Äîfor instance, if you allow a social media app <cough>Facebook<cough> to access your contacts and location, the company behind that app will get lots of data on your whereabouts and can even cross-reference that with the locations of everyone in your contact list who also uses the service.</cough></cough></p>

<p>In the end, only you can decide how much information you want to share with the likes of Google, Facebook, and Twitter, and only you can determine if or when their use of your details feels like an invasion of privacy. But by using Apple products and services, you can be certain that the company that could know more about you than any other is actively trying to protect your privacy.</p>
