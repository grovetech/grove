I"§!<p>It‚Äôs inevitable‚Äîyour Time Machine backup drive is going to fill up.
Time Machine is smart about backing up only files that have changed, but
after months or years of usage, the drive will run out of space. What
happens then?</p>

<p>Before we explain, some background. On its first backup, Time Machine
copies everything on your startup drive to the backup drive. After that,
Time Machine keeps hourly backups for the past 24 hours, daily backups
for the past month, and weekly backups for all previous months. If you
modify the same file multiple times per day, every day, you‚Äôll have
numerous versions of it in your backup set so that you can go back to
any particular version.</p>

<p>So the first thing that Time Machine does when your backup drive fills
up is start deleting those older versions, beginning with the oldest
ones. It warns you when this starts happening and tells you what your
oldest remaining backup is. In general, this approach works well, since
you probably don‚Äôt need all the older versions of changed files as long
as Time Machine always retains the most recent version in the backup.</p>

<p>Eventually, however, even this technique runs into the wall of hard
drives having only so much capacity. When that happens, backups will
start failing, and this notification will appear after every backup
attempt.</p>

<p>Click the Details button in that notification to open the Time Machine
pane of System Preferences, and you‚Äôll learn more.</p>

<p>You have four options at this point, but two of them may not be all that
helpful.‚Äã</p>

<p><strong>Delete Old Backups</strong></p>

<p>One possible solution‚Äîalbeit likely a short term one‚Äîis to delete
old backups. You might be tempted to look in the Backups.backupdb folder
on your Time Machine drive and delete some of the dated folders inside.
Don‚Äôt. You have no idea what you‚Äôll be deleting, and you‚Äôll likely
corrupt the entire Time Machine backup, rendering it useless.</p>

<p>Instead, use a utility like
<a href="http://grandperspectiv.sourceforge.net/">GrandPerspective</a> or
<a href="https://www.omnigroup.com/more">OmniDiskSweeper</a> to identify
folders or files that are both large and unnecessary. Navigate to one of
those items in the Finder, select it, and then choose Enter Time Machine
from the Time Machine menu bar icon. Once in Time Machine, click the
Action menu (the gear icon) in the toolbar and choose Delete All Backups
of <em>Item</em>.</p>

<p>Alas, this approach may not have much of an effect, since it‚Äôs difficult
to know how many backups Time Machine has stored.‚Äã</p>

<p><strong>Exclude Large Folders from the Backup</strong></p>

<p>Another approach that Apple mentions is excluding items from the Time
Machine backup. To do this, open System Preferences &gt; Time Machine and
click the Options button. Then drag the desired file or folder into the
‚ÄúExclude these items from backups‚Äù list and click Save.</p>

<p><img alt="Blog Photo" src="https://grovetech.co/assets/img/blog/2020/20200803Yo/Time-Machine-exclusions.png" class="img-fluid rounded m-2" width="700" /></p>

<p>The only problem with this advice is that it‚Äôs helpful only before your
backup drive fills up. Time Machine won‚Äôt reclaim space used by newly
excluded items that already exist in your backup.‚Äã</p>

<p><strong>Start Over, Either on a New Drive or after Erasing Your Existing
Backup Drive</strong></p>

<p>One of the great features of Time Machine is that it stores previous
versions of files, as we‚Äôve discussed. But you probably know if you‚Äôre
the sort of person who needs to go back to such previous versions, or if
you just use Time Machine so you can restore all your data in the event
of a drive failure. If the latter is true and you don‚Äôt much care about
previous versions of files, a good solution is just to start over,
either on a new drive or after erasing your current drive.</p>

<p>Obviously, erasing your current drive means that you won‚Äôt have any Time
Machine backup at all until a new one completes, which is a risk. And,
of course, if that drive filled up once, it will do so again,
potentially fairly quickly unless you exclude some large folders. But,
if you want to go down that path, open Disk Utility, select your Time
Machine drive in the sidebar, and click Erase. Then go into the Time
Machine preferences again, click Select Disk, and pick your newly erased
drive. You may have to select it under Backup Disks and click Remove
Disk first.</p>

<p>Getting a new, larger backup drive and starting over with it is easier
and more sensible, though more expensive. Once you‚Äôve connected the new
drive, just open the Time Machine preferences, click Select Disk, and
select the new drive.‚Äã</p>

<p><img alt="Blog Photo" src="https://grovetech.co/assets/img/blog/2020/20200803Yo/Time-Machine-Select-Disk.png" class="img-fluid rounded m-2" width="700" /></p>

<p>Or, rather, in an ideal world that would be true. You need to make sure
that the new backup drive is formatted properly for Time Machine. Choose
About This Mac from the Apple menu, and then click System Report to open
the System Information app. In its sidebar, click Storage, select the
drive at the top, and make sure File System is Journaled HFS+ and
Partition Map Type is GPT (GUID Partition Table).</p>

<p>If the drive isn‚Äôt formatted correctly for Time Machine, open Disk
Utility, select the drive in the sidebar, click Erase, and choose Mac OS
Extended (Journaled) from the Format pop-up menu and GUID Partition Map
from the Scheme pop-up menu. Then click Erase to ready it for Time
Machine use. (This will, of course, delete all the data on the drive, so
make sure that‚Äôs OK first!)</p>

<p>Finally, make sure the permissions on the new drive are set correctly.
Select the drive icon in the Finder, choose File &gt; Get Info, click the
triangle next to Sharing &amp; Permissions, and make sure the ‚ÄúIgnore
ownership on this volume‚Äù checkbox is unselected. You may need to click
the lock icon and enter an administrator username and password.</p>

<p><strong>Copy Your Existing Backup to a New, Larger Drive</strong></p>

<p>What if you want to retain all those old backups? That‚Äôs entirely
possible, though it will take a long time to copy. Follow these steps:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Connect both the old and the new backup drive
to your Mac via Thunderbolt, USB, or Firewire.</li>
  <li>Make sure the drive is formatted properly for
Time Machine, and if it‚Äôs not, reformat it in Disk Utility as noted
above. Also, verify that the permissions are set correctly, as
above.</li>
  <li>Turn off Time Machine so it doesn‚Äôt try to
back up while you‚Äôre copying its data. In the Time Machine
preference pane, deselect Back Up Automatically, or click the Off/On
switch, depending on what version of macOS you‚Äôre running.</li>
  <li>Drag the Backups.backupdb folder from the old
drive to the new one to copy it. You may be prompted for your
administrator name and password.</li>
  <li>When it finishes, a day or two later, follow
the instructions above to select the new drive in the Time Machine
preferences and make sure to turn Time Machine back on.</li>
</ol>

<p>One final note. It may be tempting to use an alternative method of
copying the Backups.backupdb folder, but resist the urge. Time Machine
uses special drive structures to work its magic, and only the Finder is
guaranteed to copy them correctly.</p>
