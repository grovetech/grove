I"<p>The Macâ€™s Dock gives you quick access to frequently used apps,
documents, and folders, and makes it easy to switch to a running app. In
macOS 10.14 Mojave, the Dock has another feature: a list of apps youâ€™ve
used recently that arenâ€™t on your default Dock. Icons for these apps
appear between your Dockâ€™s default apps and any documents or folders
that youâ€™ve addedâ€”look closely and youâ€™ll notice subtle lines in the
Dock that delineate this area. It always holds at least three apps, but
expands to hold as many launched apps (note the subtle dot under the
icon) as necessary; as you quit apps, their icons disappear until youâ€™re
back down to three. If you donâ€™t like this change, turn off â€œShow recent
applications in Dockâ€ in System Preferences &gt; Dock.</p>
