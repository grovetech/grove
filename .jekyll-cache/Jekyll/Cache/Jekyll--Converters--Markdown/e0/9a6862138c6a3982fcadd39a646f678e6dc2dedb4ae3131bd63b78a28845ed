I"ë<p>In a normal year, most kids would be back in school by now. But the
COVID-19 pandemic has caused many schools to offer online instruction,
and many families are now settling into a remote back-to-school
arrangement. Weâ€™ve provided some advice on working from home in previous
posts, but what about schooling from home? Here are some suggestions.â€‹</p>

<p><strong>Create a Dedicated School Workspace</strong></p>

<p>Itâ€™s hard enough for kids to pay attention when theyâ€™re in school. Just
think how difficult it will be for them to pay attention to online
classes if theyâ€™re surrounded by distractions. Even worse, just as you
need to create some mental space between home and work, your kids need
to separate home from school.</p>

<p>To aid in that, set aside a dedicated space for each kid, with a desk
thatâ€™s used solely for school work. It doesnâ€™t need to be fancy, but
kids shouldnâ€™t have to share with each other or work at the kitchen
table. If you have multiple children, try to separate them as much as
possible so they can focus on their individual work without bothering
each other. Putting them in corners of different rooms can work well;
just make sure there are outlets available for iPad or laptop chargers.
Youâ€™ll need your own space too, of course, but remember that it may be
necessary for you to pay attention to what theyâ€™re doing throughout the
day to keep them focused.</p>

<p>We recommend outfitting each desk with three things: a clock with
easy-to-read numbers, a class calendar, and a desk organizer. The clock
is key, since itâ€™s all too easy for kids to lose track of time and show
up late for online classes. Schools will probably provide an online
schedule, but a printed schedule taped to the wall helps both you and
your child keep track of which virtual room they should be in. Even with
virtual learning, there will still be paper, particularly for younger
children. (You do have a printer, right?) And where thereâ€™s paper, there
are pens and pencils. Make sure that you have plenty of extras because
kids tend to lose them at inopportune moments.â€‹</p>

<p><strong>Make Sure You Have a Fast, Reliable Internet Connection</strong></p>

<p>We realize this may not be easy, but itâ€™s worth making sure that you
have as fast an Internet connection as is reasonable. Videoconferencing
apps can usually adjust to lower bandwidth connections, but grainy
pictures, frozen video, and stuttering audio will make it significantly
harder for kids to learn effectively.</p>

<p>Also pay attention to your Wi-Fi network. If youâ€™re using an access
point from your Internet service provider or an ancient AirPort Base
Station, you might want to upgrade. Newer access points can provide
faster performance and greater range, and mesh systems are particularly
good at extending coverage. Get in touch to see which Wi-Fi systems we
recommend and how we encourage connecting them in your home.â€‹</p>

<p><strong>Get the Right Devices and Accessories</strong></p>

<p>Many schools will provide devices for your kids, either iPads or
Chromebooks, in most cases. Unless you have something newer or better
already, youâ€™ll probably want to stick with the school-provided devices.
If you do want to use your own devices, check with the school first,
because it will likely require certain software or
configurations.</p>

<p>If your children are using iPads, consider buying physical keyboards,
particularly for older students who need to hand in writing assignments
online. External keyboards are not only easier to type on, they also
free up more on-screen space for content. An Apple Pencil might be
helpful, but check with the school to make sure before buying
one.</p>

<p>High school students might do best with a full-fledged Mac, but they
probably donâ€™t need the latest and greatest. A hand-me-down MacBook
would likely be more than sufficient. Be sure to set it up from scratch
for them, so theyâ€™re not dealing with old software and strange
configurations that might cause instability.</p>

<p>Lastly, headphones or earbuds, especially for older children, are
essential for reducing the noise level from multiple people
participating in virtual calls all day long. â€‹</p>

<p><strong>Find Your Tech Support Hat</strong></p>

<p>Most schools offering online classes will have tech support available.
Make sure you know where to call or how to get in touch with support,
since you may need to work quickly to help a child avoid missing a
class.</p>

<p>Donâ€™t assume that the schoolâ€™s tech support can do everything. We
recommend spending some time learning the main applications that the
school uses before classes start, so youâ€™re ready to help your kids
with any problems they may run into. In particular, make browser
bookmarks to all the school sites that your children will have to visit
repeatedly so they can get where they need to go with a single click.</p>

<p>Itâ€™s worth making sure that you have login credentialsâ€”usernames and
passwordsâ€”written down in an easily accessible spot in addition to
storing them in your password manager. We normally donâ€™t recommend
writing down passwords, but when it comes to getting into school
accounts, younger kids wonâ€™t be able to use a password manager and you
might have to move quickly between systems. â€‹</p>

<p><strong>Provide Structure and Downtime</strong></p>

<p>Finally, itâ€™s worth remembering that youâ€™re going to have to play the
roles of both parent and teacher. Everyoneâ€™s situation will be
different, but you might find that it works well to simulate a normal
school day as much as possible, with explicit snack breaks and time for
lunch. Homework can happen in the evening, as it would in normal times,
but let the school day be over when itâ€™s done. Itâ€™s tempting to pile on
more work to keep them busy, but kids need time to relax and just be
kids. The pandemic is as hard or harder on them than on adults, and we
need to be sensitive to that.</p>

<p>In the end, weâ€™re all in this together, and if you need help on the
technical side, donâ€™t hesitate to contact us.</p>
