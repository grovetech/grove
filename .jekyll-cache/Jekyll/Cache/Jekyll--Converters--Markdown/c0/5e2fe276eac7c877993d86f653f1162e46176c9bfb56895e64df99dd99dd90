I"<p>we can move data between Macs. You can send files via AirDrop, attach
them to an email message, put them in a Messages conversation, turn on
and connect via File Sharing, or use Dropbox or Google Drive as an
intermediary, to name just a few of the more obvious approaches.</p>

<p>But what if you have a lot of data—say tens or even hundreds of
gigabytes—to transfer from one Mac to another? The techniques listed
above might work, but we wouldn’t bet on it. If you had an external hard
drive with sufficient free space handy, you could copy all the data to
it from one Mac and then copy the data back off to another Mac. To cut
the copy time in half, though, try Target Disk Mode instead.​</p>

<p><strong>What Is Target Disk Mode?</strong></p>

<p>Target Disk Mode is a special boot mode that enables nearly any Mac to
behave like an external hard drive for another Mac. You can connect the
Macs using Thunderbolt 3, USB-C (on the MacBook), Thunderbolt 2, or
FireWire. It’s best to use the same port on both Macs if possible, but
it’s usually fine to use adapters, such as Apple’s <a href="https://www.apple.com/shop/product/MMEL2AM/A/thunderbolt-3-usb-c-to-thunderbolt-2-adapter" rel="nofollow">Thunderbolt 3 to
Thunderbolt 2
adapter</a>
for connecting newer and older Thunderbolt-capable Macs.</p>

<p>Target Disk Mode is nearly universal, easy to set up, and one of the
fastest methods of moving files between Macs. Let’s unpack that
statement:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Nearly universal:</strong> Every Mac sold in the
    last decade supports Target Disk Mode, so you can be sure it will
    work with any modern Mac.</li>
  <li><strong>Easy setup:</strong> Because Apple has baked Target
    Disk Mode into the Mac firmware, the version of macOS is irrelevant.
    There’s no software to configure nor any permissions to worry about.
    Putting a Mac into Target Disk Mode merely requires holding down the
    T key during boot or clicking a button in the Startup Disk
    preference pane.</li>
  <li><strong>Speed:</strong> Because Target Disk Mode on modern
    Macs relies on a Thunderbolt connection, and you’re connecting one
    Mac directly to another, you’ll get the fastest transfer speeds in
    the fewest steps.</li>
</ul>

<p>You can also use Target Disk Mode on an old Mac to set up a new Mac with
Migration Assistant, repair its drive using Disk Utility, or possibly
even boot another Mac with it. Booting one Mac from another in Target
Disk Mode works best if the two Macs are of the same model and vintage
and are running the same version of macOS, but it might work even if
those facts aren’t true.​</p>

<p><strong>Step-by-Step Instructions</strong></p>

<p>To use Target Disk Mode to copy data between Macs, follow these steps:</p>

<ol>
  <li>On the source Mac, either:</li>
</ol>

<ul>
  <li>Restart the Mac, and once it starts booting,
    hold down the T key until you see the Target Disk Mode screen with a
    bouncing Thunderbolt logo.</li>
  <li>Open System Preferences &gt; Startup Disk, click
    the lock button and enter your administrator credentials, click
    Target Disk Mode, and then click Restart.\</li>
</ul>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Connect the source Mac to the destination Mac with
an appropriate cable. The source Mac’s drive appears on the destination
Mac’s Desktop like an external hard drive. (If the source Mac is running
macOS 10.15 Catalina, two drives will appear on the destination Mac’s
Desktop: <em>DriveName</em> and <em>DriveName - Data.</em> The first is Catalina’s
system volume; you’ll find all your files and folders on the Data
volume.)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Move or copy files as desired.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When you’re done, press and hold the power button
on the source Mac for a few seconds to shut it down.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>If you have hundreds of gigabytes to transfer and either of your Macs is
a notebook, it’s best to connect it to power to avoid draining the
battery before the copy finishes.​</p>

<p><strong>Minor Gotchas</strong></p>

<p>Two things can complicate putting a Mac into Target Disk Mode: FileVault
and a <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204455" rel="nofollow">firmware
password</a>. Both are
easily worked around:</p>

<ul>
  <li>If the Mac is encrypted with FileVault, hold
    down the T key at startup like normal, but then enter the
    administrator password for that Mac to complete the switch to Target
    Disk Mode.</li>
  <li>If the Mac has a firmware password, press the
    Option key while the Mac is starting up and enter the firmware
    password when prompted. Then press the T key to continue booting in
    Target Disk Mode.</li>
</ul>

<p>Also, the Apple USB-C Charge Cable that comes with the power adapter for
the MacBook, MacBook Air, and MacBook Pro models doesn’t support Target
Disk Mode, so if that’s the cable you were planning to use, sorry, but
you’ll need to buy a real Thunderbolt or USB-C cable.</p>

<p>Despite these small caveats, Target Disk Mode is one of the unsung
innovations that has made Macs easier to use for decades, and it’s well
worth keeping in mind whenever you need to move lots of data between
machines.</p>
