<p>Hereâ€™s the solution to a problem that clients have run into on occasion.
In a workgroup that relies on Adobe Creative Cloud apps, one person
might upgrade to the latest versions of Photoshop, InDesign, and
Illustrator, whereas others donâ€™t. Suddenly, if that person opens and
re-saves a file in the new version, those using the old version may not
be able to open it, or certain aspects of the file may disappear.</p>

<p>Upgrading isnâ€™t always possibleâ€”some people may have too-old Macs or
not be running a new enough version of macOS. More commonly, however,
the rest of the group is deep in a major project and quite reasonably
doesnâ€™t want to introduce potential problems by changing their software
in mid-stream. What to do?</p>

<p>Luckily, Adobe makes it easy to download previous versions of all the
Creative Cloud apps, allowing the person who upgraded to rejoin the rest
of the team on the older version.</p>

<p>Open the Creative Cloud app, click the â€¢â€¢â€¢ button to the right of the
desired app, and choose Other Versions from the pop-up menu.</p>

<p>In the list that appears, find the older version you want to
installâ€”likely the version that the rest of the team is usingâ€”and
click Install. Creative Cloud warns you that the app will have its
auto-update setting disabled so the newly installed old version wonâ€™t be
overwritten during a future update.</p>

<p>You can ensure that you donâ€™t lose access to older versions during
updates by disabling a Creative Cloud setting that automatically removes
previous versions of apps when you update. In the Creative Cloud app,
choose Creative Cloud &gt; Preferences &gt; Apps. Then click Advanced
Options to the right of the desired appâ€™s name, and in the dialog that
appears, deselect Remove Older Versions. When youâ€™re finished, click
Done.</p>

<p>Thatâ€™s itâ€”a potentially project-stopping problem eliminated quickly
and easily. Just donâ€™t let your Creative Cloud apps get too far out of
date, since you can go back only so far when downloading previous
versions.</p>
