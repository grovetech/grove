I"‘<p>Apple has cut the price of <a href="https://www.apple.com/ipad-9.7/">iPads</a> in a bid to increase sales, as such sales are now up over 10% on <a href="https://www.apple.com/ipad-9.7/">iPads</a> in 2017 compared with the tail end of 2016.

<p>The lower cost <a href="https://www.apple.com/ipad-9.7/">iPad</a> which was launched earlier this year replaced the <a href="https://www.apple.com/ipad-9.7/">iPad</a> Air 2 and has a 9.7‚Äù screen.
