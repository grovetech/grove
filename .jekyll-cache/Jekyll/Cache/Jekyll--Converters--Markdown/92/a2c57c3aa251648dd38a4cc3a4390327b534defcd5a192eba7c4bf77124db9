<p>As you upgrade to iOS 15, iPadOS 15 (and macOS 12 Monterey by the end of
the year), you’re going to see references to iCloud+. You might even
already be an iCloud+ subscriber! That’s because
<a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201318">iCloud+</a> is Apple’s
new name for what you get if you pay for additional iCloud storage for
yourself and up to five family members, which has been possible for a
long time.</p>

<p>iCloud+ comes with some new features as well, namely iCloud Private
Relay (still in beta), Hide My Email, and Custom Email Domain, along
with expanded HomeKit Secure Video support. Three tiers of iCloud+ match
up with the previous storage tiers:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>50 GB for $0.99 per month</strong> gets you all the iCloud+ features
plus HomeKit Secure Video support for one camera</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>200 GB for $2.99 per month</strong> gets you all the iCloud+ features
plus HomeKit Secure Video support for five cameras</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>2 TB for $9.99 per month</strong> gets you all the iCloud+ features plus
HomeKit Secure Video support for unlimited cameras</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>We expect that most people will subscribe to iCloud+ largely for the
extra storage—Apple provides only 5 GB of iCloud storage for
free—but once you’re paying for more storage, the other new features
are welcome. Let’s look at each.</p>

<h3 id="icloud-private-relay">iCloud Private Relay</h3>

<p>Whenever you browse the Internet, your privacy can be compromised in two
ways. First, anyone on your local network can see the names of the
websites you access based on your DNS lookups. Second, the websites you
visit record the IP address of your computer, which makes it easier for
advertisers to track you across multiple sites.</p>

<p><a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT212614">iCloud Private Relay</a>,
which Apple says will come out of beta by the end of the year, attempts
to block such tracking by encrypting your Safari traffic (plus DNS
queries and most non-HTTPS Web queries), sending it through two proxy
servers, and associating it with a geographically reasonable but
otherwise anonymous IP address. That way, the first proxy server (which
Apple runs) knows who you are but not what site you’re visiting. The
second proxy server (run by companies other than Apple) knows what site
you’re visiting, but not who you are.</p>

<p><img alt="Blog Photo" src="https://grovetech.co/assets/img/blog/2021/20211001iC/image3.png" class="img-fluid rounded m-2" width="700" /></p>

<p>Although Apple’s technique appeared to work well and early reports
suggest that it didn’t slow down traffic noticeably, networking is
notoriously complex. Apple wanted more time to ensure that iCloud
Private Relay works as promised with all network traffic, which is why
the feature remains in beta. However, nothing prevents you from trying
it out now. After you turn it on, you shouldn’t notice any difference
when using the Internet. Just make sure that if you have network-related
troubles, you remember to turn off iCloud Private Relay to remove it
from the troubleshooting equation.</p>

<p>To enable the feature, go to Settings &gt; <em>Your Name</em> &gt; iCloud &gt;
Private Relay (Beta) and turn on the switch for Private Relay (Beta). In
the IP Address Location Settings screen, you can choose whether iCloud
Private Relay should try to maintain your general location or just make
sure it gets your country and time zone correct.</p>

<h3 id="hide-my-email">Hide My Email</h3>

<p>Have you ever felt icky giving your email address to a questionable
website, knowing that it’s probably going to spam you with unwanted
solicitations? The new <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT210425">Hide My
Email</a> service that’s
part of iCloud+ creates random, unique email addresses that
automatically forward to your inbox, either your Apple ID address or
another address associated with an email account configured on your
device. In fact, Apple has provided this option for some time with apps
that use the Sign in with Apple service—you can opt to give them a
random address instead of your real address.</p>

<p>To use Hide My Email, go to Settings &gt; <em>Your Name</em> &gt; iCloud &gt; Hide My
Email. Make sure the Forward To address is the one you want, and then
tap Create New Address at the top. Either accept the address provided or
ask for a different one, give it a label and optional note so you know
where you used it, tap Next, and tap Done.</p>

<p><img alt="Blog Photo" src="https://grovetech.co/assets/img/blog/2021/20211001iC/image5.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded m-2" width="700" /></p>

<p>To stop receiving email from an address, tap it in the list and tap
Deactivate Email Address. In the Inactive Addresses list, you can see
such addresses and leave them for reference, reactivate them, or delete
them.</p>

<h3 id="custom-email-domain">Custom Email Domain</h3>

<p>Throughout the history of iCloud (including its predecessors iTools,
Mac.com, and MobileMe), users have received email addresses that end
with the mac.com, me.com, and icloud.com domains. If you wanted to
register your own custom email domain (like hoopyfroodemail.com, for
instance) and use that in a personalized email address, you had to rely
on another service like Gmail or Fastmail.</p>

<p>With iCloud+, it is at long last possible to <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT212514">connect up to five custom
domains</a> and use them in
addition to the standard domains. You (and each person in your Family
Sharing group) can have up to three addresses for each domain. Note that
you must have a primary iCloud Mail email address set up and have
two-factor authentication enabled for your Apple ID.</p>

<p>Although the process for setting up a custom email domain isn’t that
difficult, it’s beyond the scope of this article. You need to have a
domain registered, update DNS records with your domain registrar,
associate email addresses with the custom domain, and verify your
settings. Apple provides
<a href="https://support.apple.com/guide/icloud/add-a-custom-domain-mma473945269/icloud">instructions</a>,
and you should also read <a href="https://tidbits.com/2021/08/27/how-to-set-up-custom-email-domains-with-icloud-mail/">How to Set Up Custom Email Domains with
iCloud
Mail</a>
from TidBITS for more real-world coverage. Reach out if you need help.</p>

<p>Our take is that this feature is welcome, but it’s just for hobbyists
and families. If you’re running a business of any sort, you should have
a custom email domain with a full-fledged email service. Contact us for
advice on the best solution for your particular situation—this is very
much not a “one size fits all” scenario.</p>

<h3 id="homekit-secure-video">HomeKit Secure Video</h3>

<p>The final iCloud+ feature is HomeKit Secure Video, previously a free
bonus with the higher-level iCloud storage plans. It requires a
compatible third-party security camera and takes over from the
manufacturer’s app to ensure that no one can access your video,
including the camera maker and Apple. That’s a big deal—one of the
main problems with many third-party security cameras is that they
transmit and store video in insecure ways, making it possible for
evildoers to capture video from inside your house. (Yeah, <a href="https://www.welivesecurity.com/2020/10/14/50000-home-cameras-reportedly-hacked-footage-posted-online/">it
happens</a>.)</p>

<p>All that seems to have changed with iCloud+ is that Apple has added
HomeKit Secure Video to the 50 GB plan with support for one camera,
increased the number of supported cameras on the 200 GB plan to five,
and allowed an unlimited number of cameras for 2 TB plans.</p>

<p>As with custom email domains, the steps necessary to set up a security
camera in the Home app and work with HomeKit Secure Video are beyond the
scope of this article. Apple provides <a href="https://support.apple.com/guide/iphone/configure-cameras-iph7bc5df9d9/ios">basic
instructions</a>,
and the year-old article <a href="https://tidbits.com/2020/10/30/apples-homekit-secure-video-leverages-icloud-storage-and-preserves-privacy/">Apple’s HomeKit Secure Video Leverages iCloud
Storage and Preserves
Privacy</a>
from TidBITS explains more and provides context.</p>

<p>Welcome as these features may be, they’re unlikely to compel upgrades
for those who don’t need more than the 5 GB of free iCloud storage.
However, it’s so common to need more iCloud space for photos, backups,
and files that we anticipate lots of people taking advantage of the
iCloud+ features that come along for the ride.</p>
