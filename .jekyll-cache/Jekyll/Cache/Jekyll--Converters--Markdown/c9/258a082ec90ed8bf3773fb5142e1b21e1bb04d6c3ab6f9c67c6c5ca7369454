I"Þ<p>As a Mac System Admin working in the Private sector, I must confess I find myself like a kid in the candy store looking, and trying out new products created by third party vendors that make my life, job and the user experience for my clients easier and more productive. I must stress that most admins can not fully share in my joy due to job or security restrictions. Admins in the Government sector for example can only use sanctioned tools and or methods for dealing with common Server Admin problems. These often lead to long, lenghtly solutions that could be eased with the use of third party software solutions. The restrictions are in place to keep security measures tight and ensure that proper procedures are followed.</p>
