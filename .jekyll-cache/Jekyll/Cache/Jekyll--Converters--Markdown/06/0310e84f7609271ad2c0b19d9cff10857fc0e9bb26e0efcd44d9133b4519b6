I"Š<p>When you copy text from a Web page, PDF, or word processing document,
macOS usually includes the associated formatting, so the words you paste
may end up in 68-point blue italic if that was what the source text
looked like. Thatâ€™s often undesirable. More commonly, you want the text
to take on the styling of the text where youâ€™ve pasted it. In most Mac
apps, thereâ€™s a quick trick to achieve this goal. Look on the Edit menu
for the Paste and Match Style command (sometimes called Paste and Match
Formatting, Paste Text Only, or Paste without Formatting) to paste the
text such that it matches the style of the surrounding words in the
destination. Appleâ€™s standard keyboard shortcut for this is
Command-Shift-Option-V, though some apps use Command-Shift-V. If you
regularly need this capability in an app that lacks native support for
it, consider using a clipboard utility app, like <a href="https://www.keyboardmaestro.com/">Keyboard
Maestro</a>, to make your own universal
Paste Text Only hotkey.</p>
