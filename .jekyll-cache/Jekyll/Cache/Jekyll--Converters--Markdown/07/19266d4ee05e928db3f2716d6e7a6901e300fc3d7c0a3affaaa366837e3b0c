I"%<p>Every so often, we hear from a Mac user with a seemingly impossible
problem: a document window in some app is opening somewhere outside of
the screen so it’s effectively invisible and they can’t work with it in
any way. Just closing (with File &gt; Close) and reopening the window, or
quitting and relaunching the app, or even restarting the Mac won’t
usually help because the app will reopen the window in the same
off-screen position. The solution is to try various commands in the
app’s Window menu, such as Tile, Move, or Zoom. (You may need to choose
View &gt; Show All Tabs to get the tab-related commands.) What’s there
will vary by app, but with luck, one of them will bring your errant
window back on screen.</p>
