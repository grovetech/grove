I"­<p>Many security breachesâ€”even high-profile onesâ€”stem from simple
oversight. Thereâ€™s one spot in macOS that has long been particularly
susceptible to such lapse: the Sharing pane of System Preferences. In
it, you can enable a wide variety of sharing services, some of which
could allow another user to access your Mac remotely. They all let you
limit access to particular users, but passwords can be stolen, accounts
can be compromised, and server software can have bugs. For safetyâ€™s
sake, if youâ€™re not actively using a sharing service, turn it off. The
most important ones to disable when not in use are Screen Sharing, File
Sharing, Remote Login, Remote Management, and Remote Apple Events. We
also caution against leaving Printer Sharing and Internet Sharing on
unnecessarily.</p>
