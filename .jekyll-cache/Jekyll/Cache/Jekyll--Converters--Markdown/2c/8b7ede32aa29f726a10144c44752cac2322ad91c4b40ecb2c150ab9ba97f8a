<hr />

<p>Have you ever needed to write directions for where to find a file on the
Mac? Thatâ€™s easy if itâ€™s in a well-traveled location, like the Music or
Pictures folder, but more difficult if itâ€™s in an obscure hidey-hole.
Rather than write out instructions like â€œLook in the Chrome folder
inside Googleâ€™s Application Support folder in your user Library folder,â€
select the item in question, hold down the Option key, and choose Edit
&gt; Copy â€œ<em>ItemName</em>â€ as Pathname. (A <em>pathname,</em> or <em>path,</em> is the
sequence of nested folders that holds a file or folder, such as
/Users/adrian/Library/Application Support/Google/Chrome.) Then paste the
path into an email message or word processing document (or wherever you
like). Youâ€™ll now have the entire thing exactly where you need it, and
you donâ€™t have to worry that youâ€™ve accidentally left out a navigational
step.</p>
