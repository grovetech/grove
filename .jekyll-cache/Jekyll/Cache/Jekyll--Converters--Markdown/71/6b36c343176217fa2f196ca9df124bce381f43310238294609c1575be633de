I"£<p>Most people are probably waiting until September to buy a new iPhone,
but Apple is laying the groundwork for making the migration from an old
phone to a new one even easier this time around. In iOS 12.4, Apple
introduced a new way to migrate your data directly from one iPhone to
another. This is an extension of the iOS 11 Quick Start feature that
helps you set up a new iPhone with settings from your current device.
All you have to do is turn on the new iPhone and place it next to a
current iPhone running iOS 12.4 or later. When you see the prompt asking
if you want to set up a new iPhone, tap Continue and scan the animation
on the new iPhone using the current iPhoneâ€™s camera. Then you have to
enter your current passcode on the new iPhone and set up Touch ID or
Face ID, and tap Transfer from iPhone. Well, that and youâ€™ll need to
wait a while for all the data to transfer. If you donâ€™t see this
Transfer Your Data screen for some reason, youâ€™ll still be able to
restore all your data from an iCloud or iTunes backup.</p>
