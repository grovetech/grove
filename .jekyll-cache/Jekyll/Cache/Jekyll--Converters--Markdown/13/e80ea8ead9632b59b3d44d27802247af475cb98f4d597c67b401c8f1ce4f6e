<p>Today you can order the new iPhone X via many outlets - direct from <a href="https://www.apple.com/shop/buy-iphone/iphone-x">Appleâ€™s online store</a> as well as through carriers such as AT&amp;T, Sprint, Verizon and T-Mobile as well as the <a href="https://www.apple.com/shop/iphone/iphone-upgrade-program?afid=p231%7Ccamref%3A1100laKZ&amp;cid=AOS-US-AFF-PHG">Apple Store app</a>.</p>

<p>The iPhone X will be available at 8:00 a.m. local time starting Friday November 3rd but given the demand with lines forming overnight and Appleâ€™s warning that they predict running out, you may want to buy a different way than going to the store. Going to your carrier may make more sense if you are renewing your contract or extending an installment plan. You can now place pre-orders directly through your carrier.</p>
