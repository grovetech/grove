I"ã<p>Touch ID lets users register up to five fingers that can unlock an
iPhone, which has long been a boon for those who share access to their
iPhone with trusted family members. However, users of the iPhone X
havenâ€™t been able to give a second person Face ID-based access, forcing
those people to wait for Face ID to fail and then tap in a passcode
manually. iOS 12 lifts that limitation, allowing a second person to
register their face with Face ID on the iPhone X and the new iPhone XR,
XS, and XS Max. To set this up, go to Settings &gt; Face ID &amp; Passcode.
Enter your passcode and tap Set Up an Alternate Appearance. Then give
your iPhone to the person who should have access and have them follow
the simple setup directions.</p>
