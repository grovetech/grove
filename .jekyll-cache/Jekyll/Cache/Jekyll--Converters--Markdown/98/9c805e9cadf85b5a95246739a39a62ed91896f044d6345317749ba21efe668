I"´<p>Do you frequently reach for your iPhone for a quick check of Facebook or
Messages? Itâ€™s all too easy to let social media, the latest hot game, or
even your work email intrude on your real life. If youâ€™re uncomfortable
with how muchâ€”and whenâ€”you use your iPhone or iPad, iOS 12â€™s new
Screen Time feature can help you limit your usage in two ways, by time
of day and by time spent in an app.</p>

<p>(Screen Time can help you monitor and limit your childrenâ€™s iOS usage
too. This article focuses on setting it up for yourself; weâ€™ll examine
Screen Time parental controls another time.)</p>

<h3 id="get-started-with-screen-time">Get Started with Screen Time</h3>
<hr />
<p>To enable Screen Time, go to Settings &gt; Screen Time and tap Turn On
Screen Time. After you see an introductory splash screen, tap This Is My
iPhone to go to the main Screen Time screen.</p>

<p><img src="https://grovetech.co/assets/img/blog/2018/screentime/image2.png" class="img-fluid rounded m-2" width="750" /></p>

<p>Two options on the lower portion of this screen help you customize
Screen Time overall. Tap Use Screen Time Passcode to create another
passcode that controls access to Screen Time settings and lets you
extend time limits. Itâ€™s designed for parents who let their children use
their devices, but you could use it as a speed bump when overriding your
self-defined limits.</p>

<p>If you use both an iPhone and an iPad, enable Share Across Devices to
aggregate your usage. This syncs settings between your devices, so if
you want different setups, keep this option off.</p>

<h3 id="downtime">Downtime</h3>
<hr />
<p>To limit your usage according to a schedule, perhaps so you donâ€™t get
caught up in a game before bed, tap Downtime, turn on the Downtime
switch, and set start and end times. Unfortunately, you canâ€™t create
multiple schedules for different portions of the day.</p>

<h3 id="app-limits">App Limits</h3>
<hr />
<p>When you tap App Limits and then Add Limit, Screen Time presents you
with a list of categories and examples of your apps in each one. Select
one or moreâ€”say Social Networking and Gamesâ€”and then tap Add. Then
set the amount of time you want to allow yourself overall for apps in
that category. You can create multiple category limits with different
amounts of allotted time.</p>

<p><img src="https://grovetech.co/assets/img/blog/2018/screentime/image3.png" class="img-fluid rounded m-2" width="750" /></p>

<p>If an app category is too broad, you can limit a particular app. Tap the
Screen Time graph at the top of the screen, scroll down to the Most Used
section, and tap an app in the list. At the bottom of that screen, tap
Add Limit and specify a time limit.</p>

<p>There are a few exceptions to the apps limited by both Downtime and App
Limits, regardless of your settings. The Phone app is always available,
and Clock, Find My iPhone, Safari, and Settings appear to be exempt. For
other apps you never want limited, tap Allowed Apps on the main Screen
Time screen, and then tap the green plus button next to any app you want
to allow. Apple adds FaceTime, Maps, and Messages to the Allowed Apps
list by default, but you can remove them if desired.</p>

<h3 id="living-with-screen-time">Living with Screen Time</h3>
<hr />
<p>Screen Time alerts you 5 minutes before a time limit expires and
displays a Time Limit screen when time runs out. Although the point of
Downtime and App Limits is to help you stop playing the latest addictive
game or reflexively checking Facebook, you can tap Ignore Limit to keep
using the app, either for 15 minutes or the rest of the day.</p>

<p><img src="https://grovetech.co/assets/img/blog/2018/screentime/image5.png" class="img-fluid rounded m-2" width="750" /></p>

<p>Screen Time also dims the icon for any affected app on the Home screen
and puts a tiny timer icon next to the name. You can still open such
apps, but youâ€™ll go right to the Time Limit screen.</p>

<p>Equally as helpful is the way Screen Time reports on your usage so you
realize how much youâ€™re using different apps. It provides a weekly
report, but you can always go into Settings &gt; Screen Time to see your
daily usage.</p>

<p><img src="https://grovetech.co/assets/img/blog/2018/screentime/image7.png" class="img-fluid rounded m-2" width="750" /></p>

<p>Tap that graph, and Screen Time lets you dive into the details, for
example, by revealing your most-used apps, how often you pick up your
device, and how many interrupting notifications you receive. Much of the
information in this screen is interactiveâ€”tap various items to see
more details or adjust settings.</p>

<p><img src="https://grovetech.co/assets/img/blog/2018/screentime/image8.png" class="img-fluid rounded m-2" width="750" /></p>

<p>Only you can decide if youâ€™re using your iPhone or iPad more than you
like, and only you can exercise the self-control to restrict your usage.
But Screen Time highlights how youâ€™re actually spending time, both as
youâ€™re doing it and after the fact. Give it a try!</p>
