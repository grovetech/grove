<h2 id="copy-and-paste-from-one-mac-device-to-another">Copy and Paste from one Mac device to another</h2>
<hr />
<p>This feature is huge when you are working and using more than one device. Items you have copied on to your Universal Clipboard now will appear on another device that has macOS Sierra installed and the same Apple ID on both devices in use.</p>

<p>For example, if you need to transfer word documents, images, photos and video between devices, you can copy them over without using AirDrop, a flash drive, email or a cloud sharing platform. It is easy and swift to use. This is one of the most useful features in Sierra and employs peer-to-peer sharing via Bluetooth.</p>

<p>Press <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>C</kbd>, hold down and select Paste on your iPhone or other device.</p>

<h2 id="quicktype-on-your-mac">QuickType on your Mac</h2>
<hr />
<p>This is one of the most popular features on the iPhone and super handy whether you are crafting an email or sending a quick text. This feature prompts you with new words to fill in. It also adapts to you, based on prior words you have used before.</p>

<p>You can enjoy this same functionality now on your desktop, laptop or tablet with the QuickType function available through macOS Sierra.</p>

<p>This functionality works within Mac programs such as TextEdit and Notes as well as certain third-party apps.</p>

<p>Press Esc Alt when you type in a word and immediately a list of suggestions will show for possible words you can use. You can select any word by clicking on it.</p>
