I"ğ<p>Youâ€™ve likely seen our tip on using the Dock on an iPhone or iPad as a
temporary holding place that makes rearranging apps easier. Weâ€™ve
learned two new tips that help even more! First, you can move multiple
apps at once. Start by touching an app, waiting to feel a tap, and then
moving it (or just touch and hold and tap Edit Home Screen to enter
jiggle mode first). Once youâ€™ve picked up an app, drag it down to the
blank spot on the right side of the Home screen just above the Dock so
you can see what youâ€™re doing while keeping your finger down. Then, with
a finger on your other hand, tap other apps to â€œstackâ€ them on the first
app. Now move the stack to the desired location and lift your finger.
Second, instead of laboriously dragging the stack to another Home
screen, <em>before</em> you lift your finger to drop the stack, use that other
finger to swipe left or right to move between Home screensâ€”in essence,
youâ€™re moving the Home screen under the stack youâ€™re holding. For a
visual demo of these tips, <a href="https://youtu.be/MPCfgkT8P_g">see the TidBITS
video</a>.</p>
