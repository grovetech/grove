<p>While Apple and Samsung both profit worldwide, other smartphone providers have often been operating at a loss. Newcomer Chinese handset maker Huawei has shown strong sales t hough at $8 billion in global revenue, making it the third largest vendor during Q4. Huawei‚Äôs handset sells at $205. To grow further, Huawei needs to reach bigger, lucrative markets.</p>
