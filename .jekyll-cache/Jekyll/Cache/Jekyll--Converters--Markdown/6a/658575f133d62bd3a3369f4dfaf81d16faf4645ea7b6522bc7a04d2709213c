I"r<p>For many years, Apple’s Reminders app let you sort your lists, but in
just one way that applied to all lists equally. That was a problem if
you had a to-do list that you wanted to sort by Due Date and a list of
foods in your freezer that you wanted to sort by Creation Date (to see
which were older) or Title (for a simple alphabetical sort). Happily, in
iOS 14 and macOS 11 Big Sur, Apple finally addressed this limitation,
letting you sort each list independently. Your choices even sync across
all your devices! So if you had given up on sorting, or given up on
Reminders entirely because of this limitation, on the Mac, check out the
View &gt; Sort By menu, and in iOS and iPadOS, tap the ••• button and then
Sort By.</p>
