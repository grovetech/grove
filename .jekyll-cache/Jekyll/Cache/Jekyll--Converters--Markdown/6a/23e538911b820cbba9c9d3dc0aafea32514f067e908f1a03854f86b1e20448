<p>The interactive demos at the Apple Store consist of two vertical displays behind an Apple Watch, iPhone and iPad all equipped with the Home app. Customers can use the Home app to control accessories in the virtual room ranging from lights (such as the Phillips hue light bulb) to ceiling fans (Hunter ceiling fan). The app demo also shows how you can control other home accessories via a virtual environment demo, showcasing examples like lowering the shades in the living room and other options.
With HomeKit, you can control a lot of devices including lights, switches, thermostats, fans, and other products using the Home app and also Siri voice commands. You can control a single device at a time or multiple in combination just using one command.
For example, you could ask Siri to turn off lights from your iPhone or figure out who is at the front door using your iPad.</p>

<p>Example: Phillips Hue White Starter Kit. The Philips Hue White Starter Kit lets you create a customized lighting environment in your home from anywhere. You can control up to 50 lights and automate schedules via a wireless connection and your Home app. You can crate your own personal lighting theme with your iOS device.</p>
