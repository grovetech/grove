I"„<p>Although extremely uncommon, itâ€™s not unheard of for a Mac, particularly
an older model, to restart unexpectedly. If it happens once, chalk it up
to cosmic rays and move on. But if it happens multiple times, try these
two things right off. First, use compressed air to remove dust from
cooling vents or the inside of the Mac, if you can open it up. Dust can
cause heat buildup, which can in turn cause restarts. Second, try
plugging the Mac into a different electric circuit or, ideally, into an
uninterruptible power supply (UPS). Dirty power can provoke all sorts of
undesirable behaviorâ€”including unexpected restartsâ€”and shorten the
lifespan of the Macâ€™s electronic components. Remember, clean air and
clean power make for a happy Mac.</p>
