I"b<p>Our iPhones are the keys to our digital lives, holding our most private
photos, conversations, and financial data, among much else. That’s why
Apple goes to such lengths to help us protect our privacy and security.
But we all have people with whom we share some level of access, whether
that means shared photo albums, shared locations, or even shared
passcodes. Unfortunately, trusted relationships sometimes disintegrate,
occasionally in ugly ways that could endanger your safety. If that
happens, you want to make sure to disable whatever sharing you had with
such a person. You can always turn to us for help, of course, but Apple
has now published “<a href="https://manuals.info.apple.com/MANUALS/1000/MA1976/en_US/device-and-data-access-when-personal-safety-is-at-risk.pdf">Device and Data Access when Personal Safety Is At
Risk</a>,”
a clear, sensible PDF guide that explains the many ways of sharing data
using Apple devices and services, along with details on how to see with
whom you’re sharing—and how to stop that sharing. Even if you aren’t
worried about your safety in this regard, it’s worth reading the guide
and revisiting your settings to make sure you’re sharing only with
intended people.</p>
