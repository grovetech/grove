I"ê<p>Apple has cut the price of <a href="https://www.apple.com/ipad-9.7/">iPads</a> in a bid to increase sales, as such sales are now up over 10% on <a href="https://www.apple.com/ipad-9.7/">iPads</a> in 2017 compared with the tail end of 2016. This tactic on reducing <a href="https://www.apple.com/ipad-9.7/">iPad</a> prices is the oldest trick in the book with <a href="https://www.apple.com/ipad-9.7/">iPad</a> sales flagging in comparison to growing iPhone sales in recent years, however this increase in <a href="https://www.apple.com/ipad-9.7/">iPad</a> sales has not increased revenues greatly for Apple as the price cut has hit profit margins.</p>
