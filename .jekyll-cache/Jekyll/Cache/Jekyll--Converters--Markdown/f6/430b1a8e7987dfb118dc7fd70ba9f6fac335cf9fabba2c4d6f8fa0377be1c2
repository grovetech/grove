I"¬<p>Accidents, particularly those involving automobiles, are all too common,
and while no one plans to be in one, you can prepare for the
eventuality. If you end up in a state where you can‚Äôt speak with
emergency responders or are too shaken up to share your details clearly,
your iPhone can provide them with essential medical information.
Emergency responders are trained to know how to access these details.</p>

<p>Apple makes this possible via the Medical ID feature of the Health app,
which you can use to record medical data and emergency contact
information (this is sometimes referred to as ‚ÄúICE information,‚Äù where
ICE stands for ‚ÄúIn Case of Emergency‚Äù). Once you‚Äôve entered all this
information, emergency responders can use your iPhone to learn about
your medication allergies and other conditions, plus contact your
family. This data could also help a Good Samaritan return a lost iPhone.
(Unfortunately, the Health app isn‚Äôt available on the iPad.)</p>

<p>To set up or edit your Medical ID, follow these steps (in iOS 13;
they‚Äôre slightly different in earlier versions of iOS):</p>

<ol>
  <li>Open the Health app and tap the Summary tab at
the bottom.</li>
</ol>

<ol>
  <li>Tap your profile picture in the upper-right
corner.</li>
  <li>Under Medical Details, tap Medical ID.</li>
  <li>Tap Edit in the upper-right corner.</li>
  <li>Make sure the Show When Locked switch is on.</li>
  <li>Enter all the relevant details about your
medical conditions, medications, allergies, and so on.</li>
  <li>Specify one or more emergency contacts. These
must be people in the Contacts app with phone numbers; if the right
people aren‚Äôt there, add them first. You can‚Äôt select your own card
in Contacts, so consider making one for a fake person called ‚ÄúIf
Lost, Please Call‚Äù and listing a different phone number at which you
can be reached.</li>
  <li>Tap Done.</li>
</ol>

<p>Hopefully, you‚Äôll never have to use someone else‚Äôs Medical ID
information, but you should know how to do so. You should also teach
family, friends, and colleagues how to find and use this information.
Should you come across a bicyclist who has had a bad crash or a similar
situation, follow these steps:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>With a locked iPhone that uses Touch ID, press
the Home button to display the Passcode screen. For iPhones with
Face ID, press the side button and swipe up from the bottom.</p>
  </li>
  <li>On the Passcode screen, tap Emergency in the
bottom-left corner to move to the Emergency screen. If needed, call
911 from this screen by tapping Emergency Call.</li>
  <li>Again at the bottom left, tap Medical ID to
display the Medical ID screen, complete with all the details that
person entered into the Health app.</li>
  <li>From that screen, you can share the
information with EMTs or other first responders so they‚Äôre aware of
any serious conditions or allergies that would affect treatment. You
can also call any emergency contacts listed by tapping their
numbers.</li>
</ol>

<p>Please, enter your medical and emergency contact details into the Health
app right now, and spread the word to everyone you know. It could save
your life, or help you save someone else‚Äôs!</p>
