I"€'<p>Digital cameras have been around long enough that people have stopped
making snarky comments about how hard it is to find anything in a
shoebox filled with hundreds of unorganized photos. But given the tens
of thousands of photos many of us now have, it‚Äôs hard to be smug about
the ease of finding any given image. Luckily, Apple has provided us with
numerous tools in the Photos app to help. Some of these organization
systems you have to set up and maintain, but others work silently for
you in the background. Let‚Äôs start with the automatic methods.‚Äã</p>

<p><strong>Date</strong></p>

<p>It‚Äôs impossible to miss how Photos automatically organizes your photo
library by date, particularly in macOS 10.15 Catalina, where the Photos
view lets you drill down by Year, Month, and Day. One tip: Day view
doesn‚Äôt necessarily show you all the pictures taken on a particular day;
to see them, click All Photos.</p>

<p><img alt="Blog Photo" src="https://grovetech.co/assets/img/blog/2019/20200102Ph/Photos-Year-Month-Day.png" class="img-fluid rounded m-2" width="800" /></p>

<p>If you don‚Äôt want to browse, you can also search (choose Edit &gt; Find)
on things like ‚Äú2015‚Äù or ‚ÄúJanuary 2015.‚Äù The utility of such searches is
that they filter the displayed images to just those taken in that year
or month. You can even search on ‚ÄúJanuary‚Äù to find all photos taken in
January of any year.‚Äã</p>

<p><strong>People</strong></p>

<p>With a little training of its facial recognition algorithms, Photos can
automatically create and maintain collections of photos of particular
people. Click People in the sidebar to see the faces that Photos has
identified automatically, and if any of them currently lack names, click
the Name button for a photo you want to identify, enter a name, and
either press Return or select from the suggestions. Although it may not
happen immediately, Photos will scan all photos for other pictures of
each person and add them; if you get a banner in the toolbar asking you
to review additional photos, click Review and then deselect any photos
that aren‚Äôt that person in the next dialog.</p>

<p><img alt="Blog Photo" src="https://grovetech.co/assets/img/blog/2019/20200102Ph/Photos-People-training.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded m-2" width="800" /></p>

<p>Whenever you‚Äôre looking for a photo of a particular person, the fastest
way may be to focus on just those photos that contain their face. Click
People in the sidebar and double-click the desired person‚Äôs box to see
their photos. Make sure to click Show More to see all the matched
photos, rather than just those Photos deems the best.‚Äã</p>

<p><strong>Places</strong></p>

<p>By default, the Camera app tags every iPhone or iPad photo with the
location where you took the picture. That enables you to search for
images on a map. Click Places in the sidebar, and then pan and zoom the
map to find the desired location. Click any photo thumbnail to show just
the photos taken in that spot. If you know the name of the location, you
can also search for it directly‚ÄîPhotos knows the names of all
geotagged locations.</p>

<p><img alt="Blog Photo" src="https://grovetech.co/assets/img/blog/2019/20200102Ph/Photos-location-searching.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded m-2" width="800" /></p>

<p>Location-based searching could be a godsend for real-estate agents,
builders, and others who need to collect images by address. No need to
use keywords or other metadata, since the geotagging provides all the
necessary information. ‚Äã</p>

<p><strong>AI Object Search</strong></p>

<p>In the last few releases of Photos, Apple has added object searching,
which finds photos based on their contents. Looking for photos of cows,
or beaches, or oak trees? Just type what you want to find into the
Photos search field, and Photos might find it.</p>

<p>Although it‚Äôs magic when this approach works, don‚Äôt put too much stock
in it. Searching for ‚Äúcow‚Äù also brought up images of pigs, goats, and
horses for us. Close, in that they‚Äôre all four-legged farm animals, but
no cigar.</p>

<p><img alt="Blog Photo" src="https://grovetech.co/assets/img/blog/2019/20200102Ph/Photos-object-search-cow.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded m-2" width="800" /></p>

<p><strong>Media Types</strong></p>

<p>Sometimes, what you want to find is already categorized by its media
type. If you want to find a selfie, for instance, or a panorama, look no
further than the Media Types collection in the Photos sidebar. It
includes dedicated albums that automatically update themselves to
contain videos, selfies, Live Photos, Portrait-mode photos, panoramas,
time-lapse movies, slo-mo movies, bursts, screenshots, and animated
GIFs.‚Äã</p>

<p><strong>Albums and Smart Albums</strong></p>

<p>With the categorization techniques so far, you don‚Äôt have to do much, if
anything. With albums, however, all organization is entirely manual.
Creating a new album is easy‚Äîselect some photos and then choose File
&gt; New Album with Selection. After the fact, you can add more photos to
the album by dragging them from the main window to the album in the
sidebar. And, of course, clicking the album in the sidebar displays all
the photos.</p>

<p>Smart albums are entirely different from albums‚Äîthey are essentially
saved searches. To create one, choose File &gt; New Smart Album and then
define the matching criteria. Photos provides oodles of options, making
it easy to create a smart album that, for instance, holds photos of a
particular person taken with one specific camera over a certain time
frame.</p>

<p><img alt="Blog Photo" src="https://grovetech.co/assets/img/blog/2019/20200102Ph/Photos-smart-album.png" class="img-fluid rounded m-2" width="800" /></p>

<p>An aspect of working with albums and smart albums that can be confusing
is how to delete photos. When you remove a photo from a regular album,
you‚Äôre just taking it out of that album, not deleting it from your
library. (To actually delete a photo from your library, click Photos in
the sidebar before selecting the photo and pressing the Delete key.) The
only way to remove a photo from a smart album is to ensure that it no
longer matches the smart album‚Äôs criteria, either by changing the
conditions or by modifying the photo‚Äôs metadata, which isn‚Äôt always
possible.‚Äã</p>

<p><strong>Keywords</strong></p>

<p>If you want to tag individual images in a way that makes them easy to
find later, keywords are an excellent option. Choose Window &gt; Keyword
Manager to display the floating Keywords window, and click Edit Keywords
to open the editing view where you can click + to add a keyword
(complete with a one-letter shortcut, which also puts it at the top of
the Keywords window). Click ‚Äì to remove a keyword (from the list and
from any photos to which it‚Äôs assigned). Click OK to switch back to the
main keyword view.</p>

<p><img alt="Blog Photo" src="https://grovetech.co/assets/img/blog/2019/20200102Ph/Photos-keyword-badge.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded m-2" width="400" /></p>

<p>To assign a keyword, select a set of photos
or just focus on the current one. Either click the keyword in the
Keywords window or press its associated letter shortcut. Clicking or
pressing the shortcut again removes the keyword.</p>

<p><img alt="Blog Photo" src="https://grovetech.co/assets/img/blog/2019/20200102Ph/Photos-Keyword-Manager.png" class="img-fluid rounded m-2" width="800" /></p>

<p>You can see what keywords are attached to an image by making sure View
&gt; Metadata &gt; Keywords is chosen and then clicking the badge that
Photos adds to keyworded images. To find everything with a particular
keyword, though, you‚Äôll have to do a search and, if necessary, look at
the Keywords collection at the bottom of the search results.‚Äã</p>

<p><strong>Titles and Descriptions</strong></p>

<p>Another way to find photos manually is to give them titles or
descriptions and then search for words in those bits of metadata.
Applying consistent titles and descriptions manually would be onerous,
but you can do multiple selected images as easily as one. Select some
pictures, choose Window &gt; Info, and in the Info window, enter a title
or description. Close the Info window to save.</p>

<p>To see (and edit) the title under each image, make sure View &gt; Metadata
&gt; Titles is chosen. To find included words, you need to do a search,
just like with keywords.‚Äã</p>

<p><strong>Choosing the Best Approach for Your Needs</strong></p>

<p>So many choices! Here‚Äôs our advice about which should you use:</p>

<ul>
  <li>When possible, stick with the approaches (date,
People, Places, object search, media types) that require little or
no additional tagging work. People and Places are particularly
useful that way.</li>
  <li>If you can construct a smart album that finds
all the images you want, do it. However, it may not be useful (or
possible) unless you‚Äôre looking for a subset of photos that already
are in an album, have a keyword, or are attached to a person.</li>
  <li>Use albums for quick, ad-hoc collections or for
collections of related photos. They‚Äôre easy to make and use, and to
delete if you no longer need them. An album would be good for
collecting all the photos from your summer vacation.</li>
  <li>Use keywords to identify general aspects of
images throughout your entire photo library that you‚Äôre happy to
access only by searching or via a smart album. Keywords would be
useful for tagging all the photos you take of lecture slides, or
that relate to your hobby.</li>
  <li>Avoid relying on titles and descriptions if you
can. It‚Äôs too easy to make mistakes such that later you can‚Äôt find
items you‚Äôve titled or described. Albums and keywords are better for
organization. Leave the titles and descriptions for actually titling
and describing individual images.</li>
</ul>

<p>Next time you think, ‚ÄúI wish I could find all my photos that‚Ä¶,‚Äù take a
minute and think through these options to decide which will best serve
your needs.</p>
