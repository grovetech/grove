I"y<p>Confession time. If there’s one topic we can’t stop talking about, it’s
backups. Backups are essential, since no one can guarantee that your Mac
or iPhone won’t be lost or stolen, be caught in a flood from a broken
pipe, or just fail silently. It happens.</p>

<p>You should have a good backup strategy that ensures backups happen
regularly, but it’s not paranoid to make double extra sure when you’re
doing something that’s more likely to cause problems than everyday
activity. And by that we’re thinking about upgrading to a major new
operating system, such as macOS 10.15 Catalina or iOS 13.</p>

<p>The reason is simple. As much as Apple tests the heck out of these
upgrades, so many files are in play that all it takes is one unexpected
glitch to render the entire Mac or iPhone non-functional. Wouldn’t you
like to be able to revert instantly if something does go wrong?</p>

<p>On the Mac side, most people should be using Time Machine. It ensures
that you can not only restore your entire drive if necessary, but also
easily recover a previous version of a corrupted file. The other
advantage of having Time Machine backups (and a bootable duplicate,
discussed next) is that you can use either to migrate all your apps,
data, and settings back to a new installation of macOS, should that
become necessary.</p>

<p>As useful as Time Machine is, a bootable duplicate made with
<a href="https://www.shirt-pocket.com/SuperDuper/" rel="nofollow">SuperDuper</a> or
<a href="https://bombich.com/" rel="nofollow">Carbon Copy Cloner</a> is the best
insurance right before you upgrade to Catalina. If an installation goes
south, you can also boot from your duplicate and get back to work right
away.</p>

<p>Finally, although it’s not directly related to backing up before
upgrading, we always recommend an offsite backup made via an Internet
backup service like
<a href="https://www.backblaze.com/" rel="nofollow">Backblaze</a>. This is because a
fire or flood would likely destroy your backup drive along with your
Mac.</p>

<p>So <em>please,</em> back up your Mac before something goes wrong. It’s fast,
easy, and inexpensive to get started, and we’re happy to help.</p>

<h3 id="ios-backups-before-upgrading">iOS Backups before Upgrading</h3>

<p>Although upgrade-related problems are less common with iPhones and
iPads, they can still happen. It’s more likely that you’d drop your
little friend accidentally while juggling groceries or forget it after
your workout at the gym, but regardless, a backup ensures that you don’t
lose precious photos if you’re not using iCloud Photos or My Photo
Stream, and backups make migrating to a new device like a fancy new
iPhone as painless as possible.</p>

<p>With iOS, though, you don’t need extra software or hardware to make a
backup. Apple provides <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204136" rel="nofollow">two ways of backing up your iPhone or
iPad</a>: iTunes and
iCloud. We generally recommend backing up to iCloud if your backups will
fit in the free 5 GB of space Apple provides or if you’re already paying
for more iCloud space. If you’re not a fan of the cloud or don’t have
space, there’s nothing wrong with iTunes backups, though they’re a bit
fussier to set up and manage.</p>

<p>There’s also no harm in using both, with iCloud for nightly automatic
backups and iTunes for an extra backup just before upgrading to iOS 13
or to a new iPhone or iPad. A second backup can be useful—we’ve seen
situations where an iPhone would refuse to restore its files from iTunes
but would from iCloud.</p>

<p>To back up to iCloud, go to Settings &gt; <em>Your Name</em> &gt; iCloud &gt; iCloud
Backup, turn the switch on, and tap Back Up Now. For backups to happen
automatically in the future, you must have sufficient space in your
iCloud account (you can <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201318" rel="nofollow">buy
more</a>), and your
device must be on a Wi-Fi network, connected to power, and have its
screen locked.</p>

<p>To back up to iTunes, connect your device to your Mac via a
Lightning-to-USB cable, launch iTunes, and click the device icon to the
right of the media menu.</p>

<p>Then, in the Backups section, click the Back Up Now button. If you’re
prompted to encrypt your backups, we encourage you to agree since
otherwise your backup won’t include passwords, Health information, or
HomeKit data. For automatic backups via iTunes, select This Computer.
After that, every time you plug into your Mac, it will back up.</p>

<p>The eagle-eyed among you will have noticed that we’re not talking about
how to restore if something goes wrong during an upgrade. That’s because
it’s impossible to predict exactly what might happen or what state your
device will end up in. So if you’re unfortunate enough to have such
problems—or to have some other catastrophic failure—get in touch and
we’ll be happy to help.</p>
