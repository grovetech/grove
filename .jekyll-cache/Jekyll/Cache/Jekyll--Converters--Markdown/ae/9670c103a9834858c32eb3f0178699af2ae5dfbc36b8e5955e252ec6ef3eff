I"Ì<p>As you undoubtedly know, TYPING IN ALL CAPS is considered shouting on
the Internet. Doesn‚Äôt it bug you when you accidentally tap the Caps Lock
key and start writing in uppercase? The Caps Lock key is vestigial‚Äîit
was invented as a ‚ÄúShift lock‚Äù key to make it easier to type the second
characters on the keys of a mechanical typewriter without also holding
down the Shift key the entire time. It‚Äôs seldom useful on a computer;
Google replaced it with a Search key on Chromebook keyboards. It still
appears on all of Apple‚Äôs keyboards, but macOS lets you disable or remap
it. In System Preferences &gt; Keyboard &gt; Keyboard, click the Modifier
Keys button. In the dialog that appears, choose No Action (or another
key) from the pop-up menu next to Caps Lock. Click OK and you‚Äôre free
from accidental capitalizations.</p>
