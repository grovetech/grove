I"l<p>It’s tempting to think that most external storage devices—whether
simple hard drives or more complicated network-attached storage (NAS)
units—are relatively similar because they all do roughly the same
thing. However, a recent problem with older Western Digital My Book Live
NAS devices highlighted that there can be large differences. In that
case, hackers figured out how to cause a <a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/wd-my-book-nas-devices-are-being-remotely-wiped-clean-worldwide/">factory reset that wiped the
entire
drive</a>
of all files. (If you have one, note that <a href="https://www.westerndigital.com/support/productsecurity/wdc-21008-recommended-security-measures-wd-mybooklive-wd-mybookliveduo">Western Digital recommends
disconnecting it from the Internet
immediately</a>.)
Two tips: Although no one could have anticipated this particular
problem, ask us before buying external storage because we may be able to
recommend known good products or warn you away from sketchy
manufacturers. Also, if you store unique data on an external drive, you
must back up that drive just like your Mac’s internal drive or risk
losing everything, like these My Book Live owners did. Backup, backup,
backup!</p>
