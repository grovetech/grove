I"E<p>People whose iPhones or iPads have relatively little free space have
long struggled with the fact that iOS likes to download updates so
they’ll be ready for installation. “Who wants to wait for a long
download?” Apple thought. Unfortunately, lots of people do. The problem
is that if you don’t want to update right away, that download consumes
precious gigabytes of your free space in the meantime. In iOS 13.6 and
iPadOS 13.6, Apple has finally provided a setting you can disable to
prevent iOS from downloading updates ahead of time. Find it in Settings
&gt; General &gt; Software Update &gt; Customize Automatic Updates, where you
can turn off Download iOS Updates to be sure an update won’t chew up
your free space. But yes, you do have to update to 13.6 to get it.</p>
