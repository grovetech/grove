I"ý<p>Notification in macOS keep all the potential dialog boxes and pop ups that apps generate under control and in one place.</p>

<p>The Notification center can also provide you access to information quickly like your calendar and weather information using widgets, some of the widgets such as the weather widget are built in others are added by apps.</p>

<p>To see your notifications click on the 3 bars in the top right hand corner of macOS:</p>

<p>As you can see itâ€™s fairly straight forward to manage the Notifications widgets and handy if like me you are a Wunderlist user!</p>

<p>It would be nice to see an integration between the dashboard widgets and the notification centre widgets at some point in the future.</p>
