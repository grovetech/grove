<hr />
<p>You can also share your Internet connection via your Mac where your computer functions like a wireless hotspot and other devices can connect to it. Just like you enabled Internet Sharing via your System Preferences, you can also share it with others over Wi-Fi. You can also share it via Bluetooth or if you are connected to an iPhone using a USB cable.</p>

<p>When you select the To Computers Using box and enable the Wi-Fi option, you create a Wi-Fi Spot and the Internet connection that you selected at the top of the window will be shared with devices that connect to the Wi-Fi network. Then configure your Wi-Fi hotspot by selected your preferred network and best Wi-Fi option.</p>

<p>Click on the Security box and select WPA2-Personal. Add in the password. The hotspot can be configured without a password by default, enabling quick connections for anyone but you may want to have a password to limit access.</p>
