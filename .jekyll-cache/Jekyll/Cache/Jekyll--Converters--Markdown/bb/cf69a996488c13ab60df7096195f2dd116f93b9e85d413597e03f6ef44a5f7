I"j<p>If your Mac is anything like ours, it’s suffering from an infestation of
menu bar icons. Sure, the Wi-Fi menu is essential, and many others can
be helpful. But if you have too many, or they’re in random order,
finding one when you need it can be frustrating. You can employ two
techniques to increase the accessibility of your menu bar icons:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Delete any Apple-provided status icon you don’t
use by holding down the Command key and dragging it off the menu
bar. (To put it back, select the “Show <em>icon-name</em> status in menu
bar” checkbox in the associated System Preference pane.)
Command-dragging to delete won’t work for most apps with a menu bar
icon; for them, look for a preference in the app itself.</li>
  <li>Rearrange the menu bar icons in an order that
makes sense to you by Command-dragging them around. You can’t move
the Notification Center icon or put anything to its right, but every
other icon is movable.</li>
</ul>
