I"¹<p>There has been a lingering issue with running Network Accounts and letting the users of those network accounts use Adobe Acrobat Reader on an OSX Leopard &amp; Snow Leopard server environment for a while. The issue presents itself as a hard crash of Adobe Reader, while the user is trying to use the program. After much trial and investigation, I have narrowed down the reason for the crash to the fact that the program is trying to save temporary cache files to the users Documents folder. Since the folder is a network based folder (Network account, running mobile home folders off of the server), the program crashes as it is unable to create those files in the remote network location.</p>
