I"ç<p>In the third Quarter of 2020 Apple‚Äôs App Store made double what
Google‚Äôs Play store made.</p>

<p>With over 30 Billion app installs Apple‚Äôs App Store saw consumers
spending around $30 billion in total according to the leading App Store
analytics firm.</p>

<p>App stores have seen sustained and expanding growth in the last couple
of years with more and more companies launching App store / Launcher
store models.</p>

<p>In-app purchases, premium apps, &amp; subscriptions totaled $19 billion
worldwide on Apple‚Äôs ‚ÄåApp Store‚Äå which is twice the amount brought in
by Google Play, that is despite the fact that Google Play had three
times as many app installs with Apple having 8 billion app installs and
Google Play having 28 billion installs.</p>

<p>This shows consumers‚Äô willingness to pay for quality content over
trying many different free apps, Indeed I myself on Android devices have
found myself trying three or more different apps before I find the one
that works best for my need and then within a year or so I find that app
is no longer available.</p>

<p>Whereas on the Apple App Store I have had to try fewer apps before I
have found the one I need.</p>

<p>And have often been happy to then upgrade for add free versions or
extra features, One App that offers a premium version I have been paying
$7 a year for over the last 12 years.</p>

<p>I‚Äôve had no need to look for a better alternative as this premium app
does exactly what I want, and it is updated yearly so works with
whatever iOS device I want to use it with.</p>

<p>Game apps have seen the highest earnings made on App stores across all
platforms, with Apps like TikTok , Tinder, WhatsApp, Instagram, &amp;
Facebook taking both the largest number of installs and highest
earnings.</p>

<p>As we discussed earlier in our article about the possibility of a <a href="https://grovetech.co/blog/a-third-party-app-store-in-the-near-future/">third
party App Store on iOS</a>,
these vast revenue‚Äôs running through Apple‚Äôs accounts are starting to
attract derision and antitrust claims from developers and Governmental
bodies alike.</p>

<p>And the fact Apple is now making double what its main competitor in the
App store market is making will only add to the pressure on Apple to
ease its tight grip on iOS app installs.</p>

<p>Analysts from App Store analytics firms are predicting towards the end
of 2020 home screen customisations such as those introduced in iOS 14
will see significant growth. <a href="https://grovetech.co/blog/custom-icons-in-ios-14/">See our article on iOS 14 customisation.</a></p>

<p>This market could be very similar and maybe even more lucrative than
the in-game purchases being made which allow the game players to simply
change the colour of an object in game or gives them access to premium
emotes and weapon skins. All of which are very cheaply priced and are
mostly cosmetic changes within the game and so easy to
implement.</p>
