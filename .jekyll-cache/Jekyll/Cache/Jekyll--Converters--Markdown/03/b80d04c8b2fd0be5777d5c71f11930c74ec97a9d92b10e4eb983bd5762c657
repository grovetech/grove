I"½<p>Do you end up with so many tabs in Safari that it becomes impossible to
read the truncated tab titles? Thereâ€™s no shame in that, and Safari
12â€”which comes with macOS 10.14 Mojave and is a free update for 10.12
Sierra and 10.13 High Sierraâ€”now offers an option to add an icon
representing the Web site to each open tab. Called a <em>favicon,</em> this
tiny image is usually carefully designed to identify its site and makes
it easier to pick out the tab. To enable the feature, open Safari &gt;
Preferences &gt; Tabs and select â€œShow website icons in tabs.â€ Unlike
other Web browsers, Safari never shrinks a regular tab to just the icon,
so youâ€™ll always see the icon and some text.</p>
