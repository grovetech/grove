I"y<p>It’s all too easy to end up with a boatload of Bluetooth devices
connected to your Mac. Apple devices will likely have sensible names,
like Magic Mouse 2, but what if someone has given you a device with
their name in it? Or you’ve ended up with a device called something
really random like f023cp37. Happily, macOS lets you rename most
Bluetooth devices, including pointing devices, keyboards, earbuds, and
headphones. Open System Preferences &gt; Bluetooth, Control- or
right-click a device, and choose Rename. In the dialog that appears,
enter the new name.</p>
