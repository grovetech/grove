I"@<p>The Covid-19 (coronavirus) contact tracing API from Apple &amp; Google has
yet to be adopted across the board with countries opting to produce
their own systems.</p>

<p>However, some countries such as Switzerland are now switching from
their own system to the contact tracing API, with other countries such
as Portugal &amp; Ireland choosing to adopt the solution from Apple &amp;
Google. With Austria and Switzerland announcing they will be switching
to it</p>

<p>Countries across the globe that have managed to control the rate of
infection are looking for contact tracing apps to prevent local
epidemics from becoming pandemic (contain the spread of the
virus).</p>

<p>The reason why countries / states around the globe didn’t use the
offerings from Apple &amp; Google immediately was due to uncertainty over
issues of privacy, control of the data &amp; the fact countries were
preparing these systems prior to the launch of Apple &amp; Google’s contact
tracing API.</p>

<p>After some countries such as the UK have found major problems with
their own systems the API from Apple &amp; Google is now looking much more
promising, you can hardly blame them for not jumping straight on board
with Apple &amp; Google with the recent scandals over privacy &amp; security
with big Tech companies. Hopefully this global crisis may see big tech
show a more altruistic side.</p>
