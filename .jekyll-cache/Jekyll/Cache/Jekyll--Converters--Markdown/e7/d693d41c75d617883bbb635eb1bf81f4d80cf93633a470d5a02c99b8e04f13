I"!%<p>With many people under stay-at-home orders, videoconferencing is going
mainstream. If you work in a sufficiently large organization, you
probably have already been indoctrinated into a recommended solution,
whether it’s the built-in videoconferencing features of Slack or
Microsoft Teams, or a dedicated videoconferencing system like Zoom or
Webex.</p>

<p>But what if you’re in a small workgroup, are a freelancer, need to
communicate with members of a non-profit group, or just want to stay in
touch with friends and family? There are numerous options, but here are
a few free options we recommend.</p>

<p>One note: As with text chat, you often have to meet people where they
are, rather than where you’d prefer. You might like Skype, but be
flexible if someone else schedules a Zoom meeting or if you want to talk
with an elderly relative who can only use FaceTime.​</p>

<p><strong>FaceTime</strong></p>

<p>Since <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204380" rel="nofollow">FaceTime</a> is
limited to users of Apple devices, it’s both the easiest and most
limiting of your videoconferencing choices. If everyone you want to talk
with is an Apple user, you’re all set. But if you’re going to include
even one Windows or Android user, look elsewhere.</p>

<p>Setting up and using FaceTime is simple because every Apple user already
has the FaceTime app, it ties into your contacts, and everyone already
has the necessary iCloud account. FaceTime calls can include up to 32
people, and it’s entirely free.</p>

<p>To start a new call, either tap the + button (iOS) or start typing
someone’s name (Mac). Or, if you’ve talked to that person or group
recently, just select them in the list.</p>

<p>You can also start a FaceTime call from any Messages conversation by
tapping the avatar icons at the top of Messages and then tapping the
FaceTime button.</p>

<p><img alt="Blog Photo" src="https://grovetech.co/assets/img/blog/2020/20200401Ne/FaceTime-from-Messages.png" class="img-fluid rounded m-2" width="500" /></p>

<p>Adding someone to a call is easy, if hidden. On an iPhone, tap the
screen to reveal the controls, then swipe up on them to reveal more,
including Add Person. On the Mac, click the sidebar button to reveal the
sidebar and the Add Person button.</p>

<p>FaceTime in iOS includes numerous effects that are popular largely with
children, including Animoji that replace your face with a cartoon, video
filters (try Comic Book with an Animoji head), shapes, activity
stickers, Memoji stickers, and emoji stickers. Alas, you can’t switch to
a virtual background as you can with Zoom.</p>

<p>The big thing that FaceTime lacks in comparison with other options is
screen sharing, which lets you show others in the video call what you
see on your screen. The closest you can come is to flip the camera on
your iPhone or iPad and point it at your Mac’s screen. FaceTime also
lacks recording, though you can use iOS’s Screen Recording or macOS’s
QuickTime Player to do that.​</p>

<p><strong>Google Hangouts</strong></p>

<p>Whereas Apple separates text messaging and video calling into Messages
and FaceTime, Google combines those capabilities in Google Hangouts. It
works in
<a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/hangouts/id643496868" rel="nofollow">iOS</a> and
<a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.talk&amp;hl=en_US" rel="nofollow">Android</a>,
and on the Web, so it can be used on any computer. Google’s Web approach
means it’s easy to follow an invitation link to join a hangout on the
Mac, although that’s best done in Google Chrome or Firefox, neither of
which needs a plug-in. <a href="https://www.google.com/tools/dlpage/hangoutplugin" rel="nofollow">Safari does require a
plug-in</a>.</p>

<p>If you already have a text conversation going with one or more people,
it’s easy to start a video call by clicking the video button. You can
also start a video call with one person and, once you’re in the call,
click the Invite People[  ]{.Apple-converted-space}icon, click Copy Link
To Share, and then send that link to people in any way you want. Every
participant does need a Google account, and only ten can join a video
call at once.</p>

<p><img alt="Blog Photo" src="https://grovetech.co/assets/img/blog/2020/20200401Ne/Google-Hangouts.png" class="img-fluid rounded m-2" width="800" /></p>

<p>In comparison with the others, Google Hangouts is bare-bones. It offers
no effects, virtual backgrounds, built-in recording, or other gewgaws,
and the way it separates the chat in a video call from the text
conversation in a hangout is confusing. But if you need to communicate
with a set of people who use Hangouts regularly, it works. ​</p>

<p><strong>Skype</strong></p>

<p>Microsoft’s
<a href="https://www.skype.com/" rel="nofollow">Skype</a> is the granddaddy of Internet
telephony apps. It’s available for free for
<a href="https://www.skype.com/en/get-skype/" rel="nofollow">macOS</a>,
<a href="https://www.skype.com/en/get-skype/" rel="nofollow">Windows</a>,
<a href="https://apps.apple.com/app/apple-store/id304878510" rel="nofollow">iOS</a>, and
<a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.skype.raider" rel="nofollow">Android</a>,
making it a good cross-platform choice. Since it uses Microsoft Live
logins, it’s most easily used by those who are already deep in the
Microsoft ecosystem, but you can invite someone to join a conversation
as a guest without an account. Guests invited by link can even join from
within Google Chrome (but not Safari) without needing the Skype app.</p>

<p><img alt="Blog Photo" src="https://grovetech.co/assets/img/blog/2020/20200401Ne/Skype-video-call.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded m-2" width="800" /></p>

<p>The easiest way to start a video call is from an existing conversation;
just click the video button in a conversation. To get the link to a
conversation, click the bold names at the top left of the conversation.</p>

<p>Skype offers extras for jazzing up the associated text
chats—emoticons, stickers, and “mojis,” which are short video clips
from movies. Its video calling options—for up to 50 people—are
extensive. You can take a still photo of the screens in the call and
share them in a gallery of images, carry on the text chat in a sidebar,
and turn on “subtitles” that automatically transcribe what everyone in
the call says. Skype lacks virtual backgrounds, but it can blur your
background for more privacy. Screen sharing is supported, though not
built-in recording.</p>

<p><img alt="Blog Photo" src="https://grovetech.co/assets/img/blog/2020/20200401Ne/Skype-conversation.png" class="img-fluid rounded m-2" width="800" /></p>

<p>All these options make for a somewhat convoluted interface, but Skype
works well and may be the best free option overall.​</p>

<p><strong>Zoom</strong></p>

<p>In the last few months, <a href="https://zoom.us/">Zoom</a> has become the
best-known entry in the videoconferencing field. It’s popular with
organizations, thanks to enterprise-level features and a simple
experience for joining group calls, coupled with high-quality audio and
video. The main downside is that the company has been criticized for
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zoom_Video_Communications#Criticism" rel="nofollow">lax security and poor privacy
practices</a>.</p>

<p>You need a Zoom account only to host a videoconference; the people you
invite don’t need to sign up. Joining a video call for the first time is
easy—you merely click an invitation link, and the Web page that loads
either downloads the app (on a computer) or provides a button to get it
(smartphone). Subsequent connections launch the app and connect you to
the meeting.</p>

<p><img alt="Blog Photo" src="https://grovetech.co/assets/img/blog/2020/20200401Ne/Zoom-meeting.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded m-2" width="800" /></p>

<p>For those who don’t pay $14.99 per month for a Pro account, Zoom’s
Basic account is free. With the exception of limiting calls to 40
minutes, it’s fully featured. Nothing prevents you from starting another
call immediately, and there are no limits on the number of calls you can
make. The Basic and Pro plans are limited to 100 participants at a time,
but Pro plan subscribers can pay for more.</p>

<p>Along with its popular virtual backgrounds feature, which lets you
upload a photo or video to put behind you in the picture (a snazzy
executive office, a tropical beach, or whatever), Zoom offers a number
of compelling options. It lets multiple people share screens at once,
lets people display reaction emoji (handy for showing approval while
staying muted), can record audio or video locally (Pro accounts can
record to the cloud), and much more.</p>

<p><strong>Making a Choice</strong></p>

<p>If you’re videoconferencing only with Apple users, try FaceTime to
start. If FaceTime doesn’t float your boat, or you need cross-platform
video calls, Skype beats out Google Hangouts handily. Zoom is probably
the best of the lot, though you have to decide if breaking its 40-minute
limit is worth $14.99 per month. If not, fall back on Skype.</p>
