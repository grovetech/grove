<p>The threat of the Novel Coronairus has recently been a top concern worldwide. With many conspiracy theories, disinformation or just general curiosity many citizens are looking for more information on the outbreak from a trusted source.</p>

<p>Cybercriminals are aware in the interest in these subjects and are crafting malicious emails designed to infect your computer or steal information.</p>

<p>This means trying to get information on a virus could lead to a virus on your computer. In this recent scam people are impersonating the World Health Organization (WHO), a trusted name across the globe. Do not click links or download attachments to or about COVID-19.</p>

<p>This is the last in our Video Blog series on COVID-19 scams. If you need help with your business and or cybersecurity advice call us and we will be happy to help!
