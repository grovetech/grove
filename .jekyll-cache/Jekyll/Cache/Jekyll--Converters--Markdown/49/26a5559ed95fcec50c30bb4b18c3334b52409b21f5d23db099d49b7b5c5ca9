I"¹<p>Before iOS 12, youâ€™d tap the camera button in a Messages chat in order
to share either a brand-new photo or a photo that had already been
taken. In iOS 12, Apple changed things so tapping the camera button only
lets you take a fresh photo. To find and send a photo thatâ€™s already in
Photos, use the Photos mini-app in Messages. If necessary, tap the Apps
button to the left of the message field to show the Messages apps, and
then tap the Photos button to see a list of recent photos. Tap one or
more to add them to the message, and youâ€™re ready to send!</p>
