I"î<p>Do you have a child heading off to college soon? As youâ€™re undoubtedly
aware from high school, a computer is essential for a college student.
If you havenâ€™t been paying close attention to Appleâ€™s Mac lineup, you
might wonder which model makes the most sense.</p>

<p>First, donâ€™t buy anything without first checking with the college. Many
college departments have specific requirements based on the software
that students have to use in their classes. Generally, these revolve
around processor type, amount of RAM, and storage space. Luckily,
current Macs should meet the requirements.</p>

<p>Colleges often specifyâ€”and students usually preferâ€”laptops instead
of desktop machines. Although the iMac is an excellent machine with a
gorgeous screen, itâ€™s too big and unwieldy for the transient lifestyle
of the typical college student. The same is true of a Mac mini and
external display. A laptop is much easier to pack during moves, and it
can travel to class every day. A student whoâ€™s accustomed to taking
notes on an iPad with a Smart Keyboard and Apple Pencil might be able to
use that along with a desktop Mac, but most people should focus on
Appleâ€™s laptops.</p>

<p>In the past, it was harder to decide which model was best for a given
student, but with Appleâ€™s move to the M1 chip, which significantly
outperforms the Intel processors used in previous models, the decision
is easier. We see three primary scenarios:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Most students:</strong> Buy Appleâ€™s M1-based <a href="https://www.apple.com/macbook-air/">MacBook
Air</a>. Itâ€™s Appleâ€™s smallest,
lightest, and least expensive laptop, but thanks to its M1
processor, it has nearly identical performance to the heavier and
more costly M1-based MacBook Pro. It also has the same lovely
13.3-inch Retina display. It starts at $999, and an education
discount may be available.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Slightly better specs:</strong> If cost is of little concern, the
M1-based <a href="https://www.apple.com/macbook-pro-13/">MacBook Pro</a> offers
just a bit more performance due to fans that keep its M1 chip cool.
It also has a Touch Bar (which some people like, but others donâ€™t),
somewhat longer battery life, and nominally better speakers and
microphones. It starts at $1299, and again, education pricing may
be available.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Windows compatibility:</strong> The only reason to buy an older
Intel-based MacBook Proâ€” available in either
<a href="https://www.apple.com/shop/buy-mac/macbook-pro/13-inch-space-gray-2.0ghz-intel-core-i5-quad-core-processor-with-intel-iris-plus-graphics-512gb">13.3-inch</a>
($1799) and <a href="https://www.apple.com/macbook-pro-16/">16-inch</a>
($2399) modelsâ€”is if Windows compatibility is essential. All
Intel-based Macs can run Windows with no problems, either by
restarting in Appleâ€™s <a href="https://support.apple.com/boot-camp">Boot
Camp</a> or using virtualization
software like <a href="https://www.vmware.com/products/fusion.html">VMware
Fusion</a> (<a href="https://my.vmware.com/web/vmware/evalcenter?p=fusion-player-personal">free for
students</a>)
or <a href="http://www.parallels.com/products/desktop/">Parallels Desktop</a>.
(On M1-based Macs, itâ€™s possible to run <a href="https://www.parallels.com/blogs/parallels-desktop-apple-silicon-mac/">Parallels Desktop and
Windows for ARM Insider
Preview</a>,
but we canâ€™t recommend that anyone rely on that combination yet.)</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Regardless of which laptop you decide on, youâ€™ll have to pick a
processor, an amount of RAM, and storage capacity:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Processor:</strong> With the M1-based MacBook Air, you have a choice
between two CPUs that are identical apart from one having a 7-core
GPU and the other an 8-core GPU. No one is likely to notice the
difference for everyday software, but the price difference is only
$50 if youâ€™re also getting at least 512 GB of storage. (The
M1-based MacBook Pro offers only the 8-core GPU chip.) For
Intel-based Mac laptops, there are various options based on clock
speed and number of cores. Theyâ€™re all fine, but you pay for
performance, so buy what fits your budget and needs.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>RAM:</strong> With the M1-based Macs, you can choose between 8 GB and 16
GB of RAM. 8 GB may be acceptable, but we recommend 16 GB.
Intel-based Mac laptops start at 16 GB, which is a decent base
level, and you can go up to 32 GB or 64 GB (16-inch only). Generally
speaking, go beyond 16 GB only if you know you need it.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Storage:</strong> For the M1-based Macs, 256 GB is the lowest storage
level, whereas the Intel-based Macs usually start higher. Either
way, you can upgrade to a maximum of 2 TB. Choose the amount of
storage based on budget and anticipated usageâ€”video takes a lot of
space, as can large numbers of photos, but most other uses donâ€™t.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>To our thinking, the most obvious choice for a Mac thatâ€™s likely to last
for four years of college would be the M1-based MacBook Air with the
8-core GPU, 16 GB of RAM, and 512 GB of storage. Be sure to budget for
AppleCare+, too; itâ€™s almost guaranteed that some mishap will befall a
student laptop, and AppleCare+ covers up to two incidents of accidental
damage every year.</p>

<p>Youâ€™ll need to have some conversations with your child to find out what
they think theyâ€™ll needâ€”and be sure to double-check that against the
collegeâ€™s recommendationsâ€”but if you have any questions after that,
donâ€™t hesitate to contact us.</p>
