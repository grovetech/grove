<p>One of the most exciting updates in watchOS4 is the availability of GymKit, that helps you pair up your Apple Watch and track your workout with your favorite cardio equipment such as treadmills, ellipticals, indoor bikes or stair steppers from mainstream gym equipment manufacturers such as Life Fitness and Technogym. This is a huge leap as data was not communicated well between smartwatches and fitness machines. Now you are pulling data from your workout such as calories, distance, speed, floors climbed, incline and pace, thus offering the most accurate measurements with less device management.</p>
