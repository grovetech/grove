I"*<p>Continuing our run down of the sharing preference pane, Bluetooth Sharing allows you to easily share files via Bluetooth with other Bluetooth enabled devices. The devices do not have to be Apple products they can be Android phones for example.</p>

<p>It can be a convenient way of transferring files when two computers are not on the same network, however the transfer speeds are quite slow compared with Ethernet or Wi-Fi networking.</p>

<p>Go to:</p>

<p>System Preferences &gt; Sharing</p>

<hr />

<p>Check the Bluetooth Sharing checkbox and set the options:</p>

<hr />

<p>Special attention should be paid to which folder you allow other Bluetooth devices to browse, as if you leave Bluetooth Sharing turned on it is not as secure as other protocols and could allow unwanted people to access your Mac when you are in a public place.</p>

<p>The range of Bluetooth is limited to under 10 meters so the likelihood is small however not impossible. Leaving the default option of “Folders other can browse:” to Public is a good choice although you will need to move any files you want to browse via Bluetooth to the public folder which can be found in Users/YOUR USER NAME/Public</p>

<hr />

<p>You can also set the options “When receiving items” &amp; “When other devices browse” to “Ask what to do” which would be more secure however this can interrupt the file transfer from some devices.</p>

<hr />

<p>If you only want to send files from your Mac to another device over Bluetooth then setting the options for “When receiving items” &amp; “When other devices browse” to “Never Allow” is the most secure option.</p>

<p>As for Bluetooth sharing of files to an iPhone or an iPad you must use AirDrop, Handoff or iCloud. And we’ll cover that another day.</p>
