I"Õ<p>If youâ€™re plugging your iPhone in regularly but getting low-battery
warnings when you shouldnâ€™t, consider the possibility that something is
preventing your iPhone from charging successfully while plugged in. If
thereâ€™s no lightning bolt badge on the battery icon when the iPhone is
plugged in, thatâ€™s a sure sign that no power is reaching the device.
Another hint that failures could be happening intermittently would be a
lack of charging in the Last Charge Level graph in Settings &gt; Battery
when you know the iPhone was plugged in. Luckily, the solution is often
easy. Take a wooden (not metal) toothpick and gently poke around inside
the iPhoneâ€™s Lightning port for pocket fuzz. Youâ€™d be amazed how much
crud can end up in there. If cleaning doesnâ€™t solve the problem and you
use only a single Lightning cable to charge, try another one.</p>
