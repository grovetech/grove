I"<p>Starting back in iOS 11, Apple made Control Center significantly more
useful by letting you customize it more to your liking by adding and
rearranging buttons. You can even remove a few of the default buttons if
they‚Äôre just taking up space.‚Äã</p>

<p><strong>Opening and Closing Control Center</strong></p>

<p>To open Control Center in iOS 11 and later on an iPhone X or later (the
models with Face ID), swipe down from the top-right corner of the
screen. For iPhones with a Home button that use Touch ID (including the
just-released iPhone SE and the iPod touch), swipe up from the bottom
edge of the screen.</p>

<p>On an iPad, you‚Äôll swipe down from the top-right corner of the screen if
it‚Äôs running iOS 12 or iPadOS 13; if it‚Äôs still running iOS 11, swipe up
from the bottom edge of the screen.</p>

<p>If you swipe down to invoke Control Center, you can close it by tapping
a blank area of the screen or by swiping up from the bottom of the
screen. If you swipe up to show Control Center, close it either by
tapping the top of the screen or pressing the Home button.‚Äã</p>

<p><strong>Interacting with Controls</strong></p>

<p>In Control Center, you can interact with the various controls in two
ways: tap or press and hold. Unfortunately, the interface provides no
clues to alert you to how you should interact with any given
item.</p>

<p>Start with a tap, but it‚Äôs always worth pressing and holding to see what
options Apple might have hidden behind that button. Some buttons, like
Camera, Do Not Disturb, and Flashlight, even react to both a tap
(launching the app or turning on) and a press-and-hold (providing extra
useful options).</p>

<p>What happens when you tap a button varies, but here are some guidelines:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Apps:</strong> A number of buttons, like Camera,
Magnifier, and Stopwatch, open other apps instantly. Alas, you can‚Äôt
pick just any apps to open in this way.</li>
  <li><strong>Toggles:</strong> Some Control Center buttons, like
Screen Lock and Low Power Mode, are simple on/off toggles. Tap the
button once to turn it on; tap it again to turn it
off.</li>
  <li><strong>Sliders:</strong> Drag the sliders for Brightness
and Volume to adjust the intensity of the setting.</li>
  <li><strong>Option screens:</strong> With a few of the buttons,
like Screen Mirroring and Text Size, a tap opens another screen with
more options.</li>
</ul>

<p>What happens when you press and hold is more predictable. If you press
and hold a button that has more options (or if you press and hold a
‚Äúcard,‚Äù which is what Apple calls the collection of buttons for
networking and audio controls), another screen opens, showing controls
for those settings. Some of those screens provide even more
options‚Äîpress and hold the networking card to expand it from four
buttons to six, and then press and hold the Wi-Fi, AirDrop, or Bluetooth
button to switch Wi-Fi networks, choose who can send you files via
AirDrop, or connect to Bluetooth devices.</p>

<p><strong>Customizing the Controls</strong></p>

<p>To change which buttons are available in Control Center, go to Settings
&gt; Control Center &gt; Customize Controls. The Customize screen is split
into two sections: Include lists controls that are showing in Control
Center, and More Controls contains inactive controls you can add.</p>

<p>Here‚Äôs how to switch things up:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Add a button:</strong> Tap its green plus button. It
moves to the Include list. You can add as many buttons as you like.
If you add so many that they don‚Äôt fit on the screen, you‚Äôll have to
swipe in Control Center to see the extras.</li>
  <li><strong>Remove a button:</strong> Tap its red minus button,
and tap Remove. The button moves to More Controls.</li>
  <li><strong>Arrange buttons:</strong> For any button in the
Include list, drag the grab handle on the right side up or down.</li>
</ul>

<p>Pay attention to which buttons you find yourself actually using in
Control Center and how often you use them. Then you can adjust which
ones appear and where they‚Äôre located, so you can find them quickly
whenever you open Control Center.‚Äã</p>

<p><strong>Interesting Buttons</strong></p>

<p>Apple has a full list of <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT210981" rel="nofollow">all the controls in Control
Center</a>, but here are a
few of our favorite optional buttons, and what to expect from them:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Apple TV:</strong> This button opens an Apple TV
remote control that can replace your Siri Remote. It‚Äôs especially
useful when you need to type a search string or password into the
Apple TV.</li>
  <li><strong>Clock Options:</strong> Need to keep track of the
time? Three buttons‚ÄîAlarm, Timer, and Stopwatch‚Äîeach open their
corresponding screen in the Clock app so you can complete a timing
task quickly. Timer is the most useful because it has a
press-and-hold option that lets you start a timer without switching
to the Clock app.</li>
  <li><strong>Magnifier:</strong> Tapping the Magnifier button
takes you to a camera-like app designed to zoom in on something in
the physical world so you can see it better. It‚Äôs helpful for seeing
tiny type, such as serial numbers on electronic devices.</li>
  <li><strong>Notes:</strong> Tap to start a new note in the Notes
app. Or press and hold to bring up a menu of choices for starting a
new note with a checklist, a photo, or a scanned document.</li>
  <li><strong>Screen Recording:</strong> Want to make a movie of
something you see on your iPhone or iPad‚Äôs screen? Tap the Screen
Recording button to start a recording, then tap the red button in
the upper-left corner of the screen to stop.</li>
  <li><strong>Text Size:</strong> This button brings up a slider
for adjusting the size of the system font‚Äîthis is the text in
places like the Messages and Settings apps.</li>
  <li><strong>Voice Memos:</strong> This button opens the Voice
Memos app when you tap it, but if you press and hold instead, you
can start a new recording immediately or access recent recordings.
If your yoga instructor doesn‚Äôt mind, recording a class is a handy
way to recap workout instructions.</li>
</ul>

<p>Only Apple can provide new controls for Control Center right now, so you
won‚Äôt find any options for working with independent apps. But who
knows‚Äîas with Siri, perhaps Apple will open Control Center up to
developers in the future too.</p>
