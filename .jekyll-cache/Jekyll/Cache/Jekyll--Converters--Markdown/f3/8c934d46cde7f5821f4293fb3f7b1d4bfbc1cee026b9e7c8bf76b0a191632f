<p>Feeling left behind because you don’t have the latest iPhone or iPad?
Don’t, because Apple has a present for you in the form of iOS 12. The
new operating system promises to increase performance, particularly for
older devices as far back as the iPhone 5s and iPad Air.</p>

<p>But iOS 12 offers more than just a speed boost. Apart from adding
fripperies like new animoji, text effects, and camera effects in
Messages and FaceTime, iOS 12 helps you use your device less. That’s
important, as it becomes increasingly obvious that many people spend
more time than they’d like on addictive social media apps, games, and
cat videos.</p>

<h3 id="screen-time">Screen Time</h3>
<hr />
<p>The marquee feature for helping you control device usage is Screen Time.
Found in the Settings app, Screen Time reports on how much time you
spend using different apps, how often you pick up your device, and how
many notifications interrupt you. You can check it anytime and get
weekly reports, and use this information to help you reduce undesirable
usage.</p>

<p><img src="https://grovetech.co/assets/img/blog/2018/topfeatures/image2.png" class="img-fluid rounded m-2" width="700" /></p>

<p>Screen Time has two helpful options, Downtime and App Limits. With
Downtime, you can specify a time period when you can only receive phone
calls and use specific apps you set in Always Allowed. App Limits let
you set how long you may use certain categories of apps. You can ignore
the limit, extending it for 15 minutes or for the rest of the day, but
that’s cheating, right?</p>

<p>Even better, you can set Downtime and App Limits for a child’s iPhone or
iPad, ensuring that they can’t play games after bedtime or text their
friends during dinner.</p>

<h3 id="notification-management">Notification Management</h3>
<hr />
<p>It’s easy to become overwhelmed with notifications, especially if you
have chatty friends in messaging apps. iOS 12 can reduce the impact of
non-stop notifications. On the Lock screen, iOS 12 now groups message
threads and multiple notifications from the same app. Tapping a group
expands it so you can see the details.</p>

<p><img src="https://grovetech.co/assets/img/blog/2018/topfeatures/image4.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded m-2" width="700" /></p>

<p>Plus, with a feature called Instant Tuning, you can change notification
settings for an app right from a notification. Swipe left on a
notification and tap Manage. Instant Tuning also lets you send
notifications to Notification Center silently so they don’t interrupt
you but are available later.</p>

<h3 id="do-not-disturb">Do Not Disturb!</h3>
<hr />
<p>In the “it’s about time” department, iOS 12 beefs up Do Not Disturb so
it works more the way people do. When you bring up Control Center and
force-touch the Do Not Disturb button, it expands to let you turn on Do
Not Disturb for 1 hour, for the rest of the day, or until you leave your
current location. The beauty of these new options is that they disable
Do Not Disturb automatically so you don’t have to remember—and
potentially miss important notifications. Plus, a new Bedtime option in
Settings &gt; Do Not Disturb dims the display and silences overnight
notifications until you unlock your device in the morning.</p>

<h3 id="siri-shortcuts">Siri Shortcuts</h3>
<hr />
<p>Another new feature, Siri Shortcuts, aims to help you use your device
more effectively. As Siri learns your routines, it will start suggesting
shortcuts for common actions, either on the Lock screen or when you pull
down on the Home screen to search. You can see its suggestions in
Settings &gt; Siri &amp; Search &gt; All Shortcuts, and for those that seem
useful, record a custom phrase that will invoke the shortcut. Plus, a
new Shortcuts app lets you create more complex shortcuts that can run
multiple steps at once.</p>

<h3 id="smaller-changes">Smaller Changes</h3>
<hr />
<p>Those may be the most significant changes in iOS 12, but they’re far
from the only ones. Here’s a sampling of other refinements you’ll
notice:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Apple has redesigned the iBooks app and renamed it Books.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The News, Stocks, and Voice Memos apps also received redesigns,
Stocks and Voice Memos are now available on the iPad, and all three
have made the jump to the Mac in Mojave, with their data synced via
iCloud.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A new Measure app uses augmented reality to help you measure objects
in the real world.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In Settings &gt; Battery, iOS 12 shows graphs of battery usage and
activity for the last 24 hours or the last 10 days.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p><img src="https://grovetech.co/assets/img/blog/2018/topfeatures/image6.png" class="img-fluid rounded m-2" width="700" /></p>

<p>iOS 12 has even more minor improvements that we’ll be sharing in the
coming months, so watch this space!</p>
