I"ˆ<p>As iPhones have become ever more prevalent, one of Appleâ€™s bundled appsâ€”Find My Friendsâ€”has become significantly more useful. Although there are legitimate concerns about sharing your location willy-nilly, Find My Friends gives everyone full control over what they share, making it truly helpful for families and close friends. So if youâ€™ve ever thought it would be useful to know when your child left their soccer game or wanted them to receive an automatic alert when you leave to pick them up, Find My Friends is the app for you. Itâ€™s also great for keeping track of aging parents or for housemates looking out for one another.</p>
