I",<p>Suppose you have an older iPhone or iPad, especially one with only 16 GB
of storage. In that case, it’s possible that you won’t have enough space
to upgrade to iOS 14 or iPadOS 14 through Settings &gt; General &gt;
Software Update. That’s often true due to an inexplicably large Other
category when you look in Settings &gt; General &gt; iPhone/iPad Storage.
Upgrading using iTunes (in macOS 10.14 Mojave and earlier) or the Finder
(in 10.15 Catalina and later) is one workaround, but there’s another
that’s often better. Make a backup to iCloud (Settings &gt; <em>Your Name</em> &gt;
iCloud &gt; iCloud Backup &gt; Back Up Now) or to your Mac with iTunes or
the Finder, and then erase your device (Settings &gt; General &gt; Reset &gt;
Erase All Content and Settings). When you restore it, the size of the
Other storage category will likely have dropped significantly, making it
possible to upgrade iOS.</p>
