I"q<p>In 2017, Apple added support for Qi wireless charging to the iPhone 8
and iPhone X, and with the iPhone 12 lineup, it introduced its own
MagSafe wireless charging technology. There’s no denying the convenience
of wireless charging, but keep in mind that it’s extremely inefficient
compared to wired charging. Individually, that may not matter much when
you’re charging overnight from a wall-connected charger. But across
billions of phones, it’s more problematic. One estimate suggests that
<a href="https://debugger.medium.com/wireless-charging-is-a-disaster-waiting-to-happen-48afdde70ed9">wireless charging requires nearly 50% more
power</a>
than cable. And if you’re charging from a wireless battery pack, wasting
that juice means less of a top-up before exhausting the battery pack.
Charging speed suffers too. In short, to charge your iPhone quickly and
efficiently, whether from a wall-connected charger or a battery pack,
stick with the traditional Lightning cable.</p>
