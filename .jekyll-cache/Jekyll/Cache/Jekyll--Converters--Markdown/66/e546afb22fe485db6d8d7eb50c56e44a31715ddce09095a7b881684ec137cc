<p>After you have completed the transfer, hold down the Option key while you launch the Photos app again.</p>

<p>Now after the Photos app launches, release the Option key and go to Photos &gt; Preferences. Under the General tab, look for Use as System Photo Library. Here you can select your backup external drive as the default photo storage.</p>

<p>You will need to keep this hard drive connected to your Mac for the ongoing storage to work.</p>

<p>Notice that if you also have the iCloud Photo Library enabled, the process may take longer even if the photos were already backed up to the cloud.</p>

<p>If you wish to copy the files over and delete them from the original source, you can do this by dragging files over while holding down the <kbd>Command âŒ˜</kbd> key.</p>
