<p>Appleâ€™s latest Apple Store is one of its most ambitious. Located on Michigan Avenue in Chicago, the store is designed with community in mind and connects North Michigan Avenue, Pioneer Court and the Chicago River. Apple worked closely with the city of Chicago, reviewing historical records, to develop the store design on the riverfront in the heart of the city.</p>

<p>The new store, the second on North Michigan Ave where Apple opened its first store in 2003 that has welcomed over 23 million guests since its launch, demonstrates Appleâ€™s commitment to eco-friendly design with a data center powered by renewable energy and solar cells and building a welcoming place for community gatherings. The store is transparent and has granite staircases on both sides that open up views from the plaza to the river while the roof is built with light carbon fiber.</p>
