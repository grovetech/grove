<p>Even those of us who don‚Äôt work with graphics professionally often find
ourselves needing to resize images. Perhaps you have a large square
headshot, but the site to which you‚Äôre uploading requires it to be
exactly 100 by 100 pixels. Or maybe you have an iPhone 13 Pro photo
that‚Äôs 4032 by 3024, but you need the long side to be 1280 pixels and
the short side to be 800 pixels. You might even need to cut out an
800-by-600 rectangle from a much larger image.</p>

<p>These tasks are easily accomplished with professional graphics apps like
Photoshop, but you don‚Äôt need to pay for or learn Photoshop for a quick
resizing and cropping of an image. That‚Äôs because Preview, which is
built into macOS, can do many of these tasks with aplomb.</p>

<p>One note: You can resize images to be smaller with little or no loss of
quality, but you can‚Äôt make images bigger without them looking fuzzier
unless you employ specialized tools.</p>

<h3 id="shrink-an-image-without-changing-aspect-ratio">Shrink an Image without Changing Aspect Ratio</h3>

<p>Let‚Äôs take our first example above. We have a square headshot that we
need to upload to an account, but the site won‚Äôt accept an image larger
than 100 pixels square. To shrink the image to the specified size, we‚Äôll
first make a copy in the Finder or we‚Äôll open the file in Preview and
choose File &gt; Duplicate. Then, with the image open in Preview, we‚Äôll
choose Tools &gt; Adjust Size, make sure ‚Äúpixels‚Äù is chosen to the right
of the Width and Height fields, and enter 100 into the Width field.
Because Scale Proportionally is selected, Height automatically changes
to 100 to match. We‚Äôll click OK to exit the dialog and then save the
file.</p>

<h3 id="shrink-an-image-and-crop-to-different-dimensions">Shrink an Image and Crop to Different Dimensions</h3>

<p>Let‚Äôs move on to our second example above. We have a photo of some
home-baked bread loaves that we‚Äôve taken with the iPhone, and we need to
resize it to 1280 by 800 pixels before uploading it to our food blog.
There are two problems: the image is much larger than we need to start,
and when we try resizing it to the desired pixel count in one dimension,
the other dimension is wrong.</p>

<p>We‚Äôll start the same way we did before, by making a copy of the original
and in Preview choosing Tools &gt; Adjust Size. In the Image Dimensions
dialog, we‚Äôll first type 1280 into the Width field. In this example,
doing that causes the Height field to change to 752, which is too small
(below left). Remember, shrinking images is easy and works well, but
expanding them is hard. So instead, we‚Äôll type 800 into the Height
field, which causes the Width field to change to 1361 (below right).
That‚Äôs good; we‚Äôll click OK to resize the image. It will look small, but
we can zoom it back to the window size by choosing View &gt; Zoom to Fit.</p>

<p><img alt="Blog Photo" src="https://grovetech.co/assets/img/blog/2021/20211101Ne/image3.png" class="img-fluid rounded m-2" width="700" /></p>

<p>For the next step, we need to get the image width down from 1361 to 1280
pixels, which we do by cropping. Choose Edit &gt; Select All (or just
press Command-A), and notice that there‚Äôs a selection rectangle around
the entire image, with blue drag handles in the middle of each side and
at each corner. We‚Äôll need to take some off each side to keep the loaves
centered, so we‚Äôll drag the left side in a little to start. If you have
trouble grabbing the blue drag handles instead of the edge of Preview‚Äôs
window, choose View &gt; Zoom Out to zoom out one step and separate the
handles from the window edges.</p>

<p><img alt="Blog Photo" src="https://grovetech.co/assets/img/blog/2021/20211101Ne/image4.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded m-2" width="700" /></p>

<p>Next, we‚Äôll drag the right side in. Notice that as we drag, Preview
displays the image dimensions in a little lozenge (at the right in the
screenshot)‚Äîwe‚Äôve stopped at 1280. Since we‚Äôre moving only the edges,
only the width changes‚Äîresizing from the corners would be much harder
because both dimensions would change simultaneously.</p>

<p>One tip. If you‚Äôve gotten the selection rectangle to 1280 by 800, but
the content under it isn‚Äôt centered as you‚Äôd like, press and hold the
left or right arrow key to move the selection rectangle to the left or
right.</p>

<p>Once we have the selection rectangle at the right size and in the right
place, we‚Äôll choose Tools &gt; Crop to discard the image content outside
the selection.</p>

<h3 id="extract-a-portion-of-an-image-with-specific-dimensions">Extract a Portion of an Image with Specific Dimensions</h3>

<p>For our final example, let‚Äôs assume that we have a large picture of
cherry tomatoes, and we need to cut out just the black tomatoes for a
Web page that requires an 800-by-600 image. Once again, the image is too
large, but the trickier problem is that we only need a small portion of
it.</p>

<p>We‚Äôll start by dragging out a selection rectangle that‚Äôs roughly 800 by
600, using Preview‚Äôs measurement lozenge. All we‚Äôre doing here is
getting a sense of what the shape of 800 by 600 looks like. Then we make
another selection around the black cherry tomatoes that‚Äôs roughly the
same aspect ratio, wider than it is tall. The details don‚Äôt matter much
at this point.</p>

<p><img alt="Blog Photo" src="https://grovetech.co/assets/img/blog/2021/20211101Ne/image5.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded m-2" width="700" /></p>

<p>The next step is to crop the photo to the selection with Tools &gt; Crop.
Then we choose Tools &gt; Adjust Size and set the Width field to 800 to
get the width correct. That reveals that the height of our rough crop
was slightly too large, at 630 pixels. We‚Äôll click OK to resize the
image to those dimensions.</p>

<p><img alt="Blog Photo" src="https://grovetech.co/assets/img/blog/2021/20211101Ne/image6.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded m-2" width="700" /></p>

<p>Finally, we‚Äôll use the same technique we did in the example above, with
Select All, dragging the top handle down until the dimensions are 800 by
600, and then using Tools &gt; Crop to discard the extra content.</p>

<p><img alt="Blog Photo" src="https://grovetech.co/assets/img/blog/2021/20211101Ne/image7.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded m-2" width="700" /></p>

<p>As you can see, you can do a lot with just three basic techniques in
Preview:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Using Tools &gt; Adjust Size to resize the entire image</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Dragging out selection rectangles while paying attention to the
measurements</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Using Tools &gt; Crop to get rid of content outside the selection
rectangle</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>We won‚Äôt pretend that Preview is the ultimate graphics tool, but it‚Äôs
capable, easy to use, and on every Mac.</p>
