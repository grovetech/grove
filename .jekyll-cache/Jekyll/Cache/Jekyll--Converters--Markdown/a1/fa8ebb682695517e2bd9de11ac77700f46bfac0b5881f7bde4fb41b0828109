I"²<p>iOS 11 is reported to have been installed on nearly 55% of iOS devices after only one month of being launched.</p>

<p>So what? Well it makes the platform more secure as Apple can focus itâ€™s team on supporting the latest version(s) of iOS instead of providing patched to older versions.</p>

<p>It makes Apps better quicker as App developers do not need to make as many versions of their Apps to support outdated versions of iOS.</p>

<p>Apple has already released several small updates to iOS 11 , addressing bugs discovered since the launch iOS 11 back in mid September.</p>

<p>The latest iOS 11.0.3, fixes issues with haptic feedback &amp; slow displays, the previous update iOS 11.0.2 fixed an annoying problem causing the iPhone 8 and 8 Plus speaker to crackle during phone calls.</p>

<p>Kudos to Apple users and keep those devices up to date! The 11.1 patch fixed a serious security vulnerability with WPA2 Wi-Fi vulnerability .</p>
