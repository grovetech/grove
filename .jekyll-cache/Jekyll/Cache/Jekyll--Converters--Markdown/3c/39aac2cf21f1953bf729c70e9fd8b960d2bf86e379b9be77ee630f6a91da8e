<p>HomePod comes with an A8 chip that powers Siri and room-sensing technology. HomePod is also spatially aware, which means that this powerful device can analyze the acoustics of a room and then adjust the sound based on its location in that room. HomePod includes new technology such as AirPlay 2 for multi-speaker support so that several HomePods can communicate with each other wirelessly.

<hr />
<p>HomePod is designed to work with Apple Music. Siri‚Äôs knowledge of music has certainly grown and this is evident in HomePod where you can ask questions like, ‚ÄúWho is singing?‚Äù You can also do more things with Siri and Apple Music like ‚ÄúAdd this to my workout playlist‚Äù or ‚ÄúPlay something new.‚Äù</p>

<h3 id="touch-input">Touch Input</h3>
<hr />
<p>Like the Amazon Echo, HomePod does not have a screen and is operated by voice activation. You can touch a few things however for some functionality. Tapping the top of the HomePod lets you play, pause or adjust the volume of what you are playing.</p>

<p>When you talk to the HomePod, it will light up to display an LED waveform just like Siri interacts when you talk.</p>

<p>Available in the U.S. in December 2017 (expected), followed by the UK and Australia, and then more countries to follow in 2018.</p>

<p>Available in both White and Space Gray finishes.</p>
