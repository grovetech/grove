  <p>Hey! My name is Mikaela Donelan - a world traveler and strategic thinker among many other skills and attributes. During my career, I’ve been a marketing specialist, brand strategist and Project Manager. As my career progressed, I continued to find myself naturally stepping into PM roles. With all of my past roles, some of my favorite memories were my interactions with clients - sharing the joy of a project well done.</p>

  <p>When I found the Client Success and Project Manager role with Grove, I was immediately intrigued by the combination of being an advocate for clients and also getting to wear a project manager hat.</p>

  <p>My expectation for myself in this position is to grow as Grove Technologies grows. My role is diverse and I expect to continue to fine tune my skills in Project Management, Client Success and Sales/Marketing to lay a reliable and efficient foundation for Grove Technologies to make leaps and bounds in offering new services to current and future clients.</p>

Through these travels, I’ve gained knowledge of and experienced a plortha of cultures, ways of thinking and living, foods, languages, and so much more. I also enjoy reading, keeping up with international friends, hosting dinner parties, trekking, exploring new restaurants, going to concerts (pre-pandemic of course!), meditation, being a life coach to family and friends, brand strategy consulting, and more.</p>
