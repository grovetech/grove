<hr />

<p>By default, Apple locates the Dock at the bottom of the Mac’s screen. If
that location interferes with you seeing as much of your document
windows as you’d like, you can set it to appear only when you move the
pointer to the bottom edge of the screen. But there’s a better way: put
the Dock on the side of the screen where there’s plenty of horizontal
room and it won’t get in the way of most document windows. Open System
Preferences &gt; Dock, and select Right or Left from the Position on
Screen radio buttons.</p>
