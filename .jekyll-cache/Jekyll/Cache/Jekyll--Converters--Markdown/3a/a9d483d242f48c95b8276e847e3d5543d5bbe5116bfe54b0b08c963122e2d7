I"ì<p>It‚Äôs common to want to share files, photos, and other data between your
devices‚Äîor with friends and family. When the desired person or device
isn‚Äôt nearby, it‚Äôs easiest to use Messages or Mail. But what if you want
to move a file between two of your Macs, from your iPhone to your Mac,
or to your friend who‚Äôs across the table? For transfers within immediate
proximity, Apple provides AirDrop, a quick and easy way to move data
between devices.‚Äã</p>

<h3 id="make-sure-airdrop-is-ready-to-go">Make Sure AirDrop Is Ready to Go</h3>

<p>First off, AirDrop requires both Wi-Fi and Bluetooth, so make sure both
are enabled. If you use wired Ethernet on your Mac, enable Wi-Fi as
well, but put the Wi-Fi service beneath the Ethernet service in System
Preferences &gt; Network (click the down-pointing arrow under the list and
choose Set Service Order).</p>

<p>Next, make sure other devices can discover you. On the Mac, choose Go &gt;
AirDrop and, near the bottom of the Finder window that appears, choose
Everyone from the pop-up menu. (If you‚Äôre out in public and random
people keep trying to send you files, which would be weird, choose
Contacts Only instead.) On an iPhone or iPad, go to Settings &gt; General</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>AirDrop and select Everyone.</p>

<h3 id="send-a-file-or-photo-via-airdrop">Send a File or Photo via AirDrop</h3>

<p>Apple has integrated AirDrop into the standard sharing mechanism in
macOS, iOS, and iPadOS, so sharing via AirDrop works the same as sharing
via most other apps.</p>

<p>In the Finder on the Mac, the easiest approach may be to select AirDrop
in a Finder window‚Äôs sidebar and then drag files to the icon
representing the destination device (below left). You can also select
one or more files and choose File &gt; Share &gt; AirDrop or Control-click
them and choose Share &gt; AirDrop, both of which present a dialog from
which you can select the destination (below right). The right-hand
dialog is also what you‚Äôll see if you use the Share option in Photos or
any other app.</p>

<p>On an iPhone or iPad, when you‚Äôre viewing the item you want to share,
tap the Share button to bring up the Share sheet. You may be able to tap
the AirDrop icon for the desired destination directly in the top row,
but if it doesn‚Äôt show what you want, tap the general AirDrop icon in
the second row to display the AirDrop screen with icons for all
available destinations. Either way, tap the destination to send the
file.</p>

<h3 id="receive-data-via-airdrop">Receive Data via AirDrop</h3>

<p>On the receiving side, AirDrop is utterly simple, particularly when
transferring files between your devices, though the experience varies a
little depending on the direction and file type.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Receiving on a Mac:</strong> If you‚Äôre transferring between your own
devices, you don‚Äôt need to do anything; the file will appear in the
Downloads folder of the destination Mac. Files sent from other
people will appear there too, but you‚Äôll get a prompt asking you to
accept or decline the file, and if you accept, an option to open it
in the appropriate app.

  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Receiving on an iPhone/iPad:</strong> Receiving on an iPhone or iPad is
similar, with one additional step. Unless iOS/iPadOS knows where the
file should go (images always import into Photos automatically, for
instance), it prompts you with a list of apps that can open the
file. Files you transfer between your own devices are accepted
automatically; for files from other people, you must tap the Accept
button first.

</ul>

<h3 id="troubleshooting">Troubleshooting</h3>

<p>AirDrop has been around since Mac OS X 10.7 Lion in 2011 and has seen
significant updates since then. So if you had trouble getting AirDrop to
work years ago, it‚Äôs worth revisiting the feature. That said, problems
can still crop up:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>If a Mac doesn‚Äôt appear as an AirDrop destination, make sure it has
Wi-Fi active. Ethernet is not sufficient. Also, if the Mac‚Äôs
firewall is active, check that it allows incoming connections. Open
System Preferences &gt; Security &amp; Privacy &gt; Firewall &gt; Firewall
Options and deselect ‚ÄúBlock all incoming connections.‚Äù</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If an iPhone doesn‚Äôt appear as an AirDrop destination, make sure
Personal Hotspot is turned off in Settings &gt; Personal Hotspot.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Because AirDrop relies on Bluetooth and Wi-Fi, interference with
either, or a separation between devices of more than 30 feet (9
meters), can cause performance and reliability to suffer.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For best results, make sure you‚Äôre using recent Apple hardware
running the latest versions of macOS, iOS, and iPadOS. Apple has
improved AirDrop over the years, and it works significantly better
than it did years ago. Technically, AirDrop requires a Mac
introduced in 2012 (excluding the 2012 Mac Pro) or later running OS
X 10.10 Yosemite or later. On the mobile device side, the iPhone,
iPad, or iPod touch must be running at least iOS 7.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If you‚Äôre prompted to accept transfers between your own devices,
that‚Äôs an indication that the devices aren‚Äôt logged in to the same
iCloud account.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Although AirDrop has no explicit size limit, very large files (over
500 MB) will take a long time to transfer and are more likely to
fail due to network issues during the transfer.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If you can‚Äôt find a transferred file in the destination Mac‚Äôs
Downloads folder, remember that it retains its original creation and
modification dates, so it might be sorting differently than you
expect.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Next time you need to move data between nearby Apple devices, give
AirDrop a try!</p>
