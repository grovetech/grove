I"Ÿ<p>You know how to use the Camera app on your iPhone or iPad to take a
video, but did you know that you can also record a video of what happens
on the screen of your device? Thatâ€™s useful if youâ€™re trying to explain
the steps of some technical process to a friend or show a tech support
rep whatâ€™s going wrong in an app or Web site. You could also use a
screen recording to copy a video from Facebook, for instance, that you
want to send to a social mediaâ€“averse friend.</p>

<p>First, to get set up, go to Settings &gt; Control Center &gt; Customize
Controls and tap the green + button next to Screen Recording to add it
to the list of controls that appear in Control Center. Drag it in the
list to rearrange where its round Record button will show up in Control
Center. Hereâ€™s a screen recording showing those steps:</p>

<p>Making your first screen recording is simple. Follow these steps:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Open Control Center. (Swipe up from the bottom edge of the screen,
or, if youâ€™re using an iPhone X or later, or an iPad running iOS 12,
swipe down from the top-right corner of the screen.)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Press deeply on the Screen Recording button to open a menu. If you
want to record your voice via the microphone as well, tap the
Microphone button to turn it on.<br />

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Tap Start Recording, and then wait for the 3-second countdown.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Perform the actions that you want to be recorded.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To stop the recording, either enter Control Center again and tap the
red Record button or tap the red status icon at the upper left of
the screen and tap Stop. A notification appears, telling you that
your screen recording was saved to Photos.<br />

  </li>
</ol>

<p>In fact, if you want to keep your options for the destination app and
microphone at their current settings, making a screen recording is even
easier:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Open Control Center.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Tap the Record button instead of pressing deeply.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Perform your actions.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Stop the recording via Control Center or the red status bar.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>Told you it was simple. But we bet you have questions, so letâ€™s provide
some answers.</p>

<p><strong>Where did my screen recording go?</strong></p>

<p>As the notification informs you, screen recordings end up in the Photos
app, just like any other photo or video. Youâ€™ll see them both in the
Photos view and in Albums &gt; Media Types &gt; Videos.</p>

<p><strong>What are Messenger and Skype doing in the screenshot earlier?</strong></p>

<p>Instead of recording your screen to a video file, you can instead
broadcast it to a Facebook Messenger or Skype chat. That might be useful
for a quick show-and-tell while having a conversation.</p>

<p><strong>Can I edit the screen recording?</strong></p>

<p>Yes, although the Photos app limits you to trimming frames from the
start and end of the video (which actually creates a new video with your
selection rather than editing the original). For more significant
editing, tap the â€¢â€¢â€¢ button in the Photos edit interface and send the
video to iMovie.</p>

<p><strong>Is there any way to show my taps and drags in the screen recording?</strong></p>

<p>Yes, but itâ€™s not easy. Thereâ€™s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DAXxgBo-Mr4" rel="nofollow">a trick that relies on iOSâ€™s
Accessibility
features</a>, but
itâ€™s way too clumsy and leaves the Assistive Touch button on the screen
the entire time. A better approach would be to use a dedicated app like
<a href="http://www.telestream.net/screenflow/overview.htm" rel="nofollow">ScreenFlow</a>
(which is what we used above) to insert circles where your fingers touch
down, but thatâ€™s worthwhile only for videos where you need higher
production values.</p>

<p>For the most part, though, the point of screen recordings is not to make
the perfect movieâ€”itâ€™s to create and share a video of something that
would otherwise be difficult or impossible to convey.</p>
