I"Ê<p>At a special event at the Brooklyn Academy of Music, Apple threw back
the curtains on significant updates to the long-ignored MacBook Air and
even longer-ignored Mac mini. Then Tim Cook and company followed up with
revamped 11-inch and 12.9-inch iPad Pros, complete with an enhanced
Smart Keyboard Folio and redesigned Apple Pencil. You can order all of
Appleâ€™s new gear right away, though demand may delay shipping for a week
or two on some items.</p>
