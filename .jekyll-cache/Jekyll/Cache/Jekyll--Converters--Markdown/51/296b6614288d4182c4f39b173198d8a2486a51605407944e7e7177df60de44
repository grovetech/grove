I";<p>For unknown reasons, Apple redesigned the toolbar in the iOS 13 version
of Mail. Such things happen, but this time, Apple made a big mistake and
moved Mail’s Trash button to where its Reply button used to be. Lots of
people who have become accustomed to tapping Reply are now finding
themselves deleting messages inadvertently, since a tap in the same
location in iOS 13 deletes the message. It’s hard to retrain muscle
memory—the ability to reproduce a particular movement without
conscious thought—but if you find yourself deleting messages
accidentally, you’ll need to slow down and remember to tap the new
location of the Reply button.</p>
