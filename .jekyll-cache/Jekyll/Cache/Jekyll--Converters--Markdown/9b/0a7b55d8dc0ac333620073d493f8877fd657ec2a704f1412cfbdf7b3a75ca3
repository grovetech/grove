<p>Grove Technologies has been named as one of the world‚Äôs premier managed
service providers on the prestigious 2020 annual Channel Futures MSP 501
rankings.</p>

<p>For the 13th year running, MSPs from around the globe completed an
exhaustive survey and application this spring to self-report product
offerings, annual total and recurring revenues, profits, revenue mix,
growth opportunities and company and customer demographic information.
Applicants are ranked on a unique methodology that weights revenue
figures according to long-term health and viability; commitment to
recurring revenue; and operational efficiency.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.channelfutures.com/">Channel Futures</a> is pleased to name
<strong>Grove Technologies</strong> to the 2020 MSP 501.</p>

<p>‚ÄúBeing nominated and then winning a spot in the coveted top 20 is
amazing. We started in 2014 with a simple premise, provide efficient and
meaningful IT solutions to small companies, and build relationships that
last. It‚Äôs amazing to see we outranked many competitors in our area, we
know that‚Äôs due to our unmatched customer service.‚Äù¬†</p>

<p>In the 13 years since its inception, the MSP 501 has evolved from a
competitive ranking list into a vibrant group of service providers,
vendors, distributors, consultants and industry analysts working
together to define the growing managed service opportunity.</p>

<p>‚ÄúFor the third year running, the applicant pool for the annual MSP 501
has grown year-over-year, making this year‚Äôs list the most competitive
in the survey‚Äôs history,‚Äù says Kris Blackmon, Senior Content Director at
Channel Partners and Channel Futures. ‚ÄúThe MSP 501 leveraged judgement
methodology brand-new in 2020 to drill down into not just what makes a
big managed service provider, but what makes a great managed service
provider. The 2020 winners are truly the best examples of innovation,
business acumen and strategic savvy on the planet. We extend our
heartfelt congratulations to the 2020 winners and gratitude to the
thousands of MSPs that have contributed to the continuing growth and
success of both the 501 and the thriving managed services sector.‚Äù</p>
