I"½<p>In iOS 14 and iPadOS 14, Apple added two new status indicators to the
right side of the status bar at the top of the screen. Theyâ€™re designed
to give you feedback about what an app is doing. An orange dot indicates
that an app is using the microphone, and a green dot means that an app
is using the camera (and possibly the microphone as well). Theyâ€™re
subtle and shouldnâ€™t be distracting, but if you ever notice them when
you donâ€™t think the camera or microphone should be in use, look for apps
that might be using them in the background.</p>
