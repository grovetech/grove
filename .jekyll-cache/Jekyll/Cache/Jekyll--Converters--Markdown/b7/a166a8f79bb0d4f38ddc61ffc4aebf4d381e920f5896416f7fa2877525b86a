I"Ñ<p>Box, Dropbox, Google Drive, and Microsoft OneDrive all have their place,
but as of March 2020, Apple users no longer have to venture outside the
Apple ecosystem for online folder sharing. Before then, you could share
a single file in iCloud with another iCloud user, but nothing more. With
iCloud Drive Folder Sharing, you can share an entire folder, complete
with permissions that control what your collaborators can do with the
contents of the folder.‚Äã</p>

<h3 id="pros-and-cons">Pros and Cons</h3>

<p>Why use iCloud Drive Folder Sharing instead of the more established
services? Cost is the main one. Say you‚Äôre already paying Apple $9.99
for 2 TB of storage so you can use iCloud Photos with a large library.
Why pay one of the other services another $9.99 per month‚Äî$240 per
year‚Äîwhen you can get the same capabilities using iCloud? (Dropbox
used to be entirely usable at its free level for those who didn‚Äôt need
much shared storage, but users at that tier are also limited to just
three devices, rendering it problematic for anyone with an iPhone, iPad,
and desktop and laptop Macs.)</p>

<p>The main reason not to use iCloud Drive Folder Sharing is if the people
with whom you want to share documents aren‚Äôt Apple users. Such people
can get a free iCloud account if they <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204316">create an Apple
ID</a> and then access iCloud
Drive in a Web browser. Windows users can instead install <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204301">iCloud for
Windows</a> to access it in
Windows Explorer. But that may be too much effort for many.‚Äã</p>

<h3 id="icloud-drive-folder-sharing-on-the-mac">iCloud Drive Folder Sharing on the Mac</h3>

<p>First off, make sure iCloud Drive is selected in System Preferences &gt;
Apple ID &gt; iCloud. If you have plenty of storage, leave Optimize Mac
Storage unchecked. It‚Äôs worthwhile only if your Mac‚Äôs internal drive is
nearly full.</p>

<p><img alt="Blog Photo" src="https://grovetech.co/assets/img/blog/2021/20210401Tr/image3.png" class="img-fluid rounded m-2" width="400" /></p>

<p>On the Mac, iCloud Drive creates a special
folder to hold all the data mirrored to iCloud. You can access it by
choosing Go &gt; iCloud Drive in the Finder. It‚Äôs usually available in the
sidebar of Finder windows too. If not, open Finder &gt; Preferences &gt;
Sidebar and select iCloud Drive.</p>

<p>You‚Äôll likely see quite a few folders in iCloud Drive already, with
names and icons matching apps that synchronize their data and files via
iCloud. These folders exist purely for you and your apps‚Äîyou can‚Äôt
share them. However, you can create and share other folders within
iCloud Drive.</p>

<p>To share a folder you‚Äôve created, Control- or right-click it and choose
Share &gt; Share Folder to display a Share Folder dialog. You need to do
three things here:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>From the Who Can Access pop-up menu, choose between ‚ÄúOnly people you
invite‚Äù and ‚ÄúAnyone with the link.‚Äù With the latter, you‚Äôre opting
for security only through obscurity, so avoid that option if the
data in the folder is confidential or important.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>From the Permission pop-up menu, choose between ‚ÄúCan make changes‚Äù
and ‚ÄúView only.‚Äù Think carefully about this choice‚Äîview-only users
can still copy files out of the folder and change them locally on
their computers. However, they won‚Äôt be able to change your versions
of shared files or add new files to the folder.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Despite its position at the top of the dialog, choose the manner of
sending the invitation last. If you‚Äôre sharing only with people you
invite, you can select a sharing method and enter their email
addresses or phone numbers. For folders shared with anyone who has
the link, you don‚Äôt need to enter information for specific users.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p><img alt="Blog Photo" src="https://grovetech.co/assets/img/blog/2021/20210401Tr/image4.png" class="img-fluid rounded m-2" width="700" /></p>

<p>When the people with whom you‚Äôre sharing the folder receive the sharing
invitation or link and open it, the shared folder is added to their
iCloud Drive folder. Its icon will have silhouettes of multiple people
to indicate it‚Äôs a shared folder.</p>

<p>What if you need to invite more people, change permissions, get the
sharing link again, or stop sharing entirely? Control- or right-click
and choose Share &gt; Manage Shared Folder (there‚Äôs also a Copy Link
option there). A new dialog appears.</p>

<p>Most of the controls here are self-explanatory, but note that you can
revoke a person‚Äôs access and change their permission level by clicking
the ‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢ button in the row next to their name.‚Äã</p>

<h3 id="icloud-drive-folder-sharing-in-iosipados">iCloud Drive Folder Sharing in iOS/iPadOS</h3>

<p>The process is similar in iOS and iPadOS. Follow these instructions in
the Files app:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Press and hold on the folder you want to share.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the sheet that appears, tap Share.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the Share sheet that appears, tap Share Folder in iCloud.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On the Share Folder screen, first tap Share Options and set Who Can
Access and Permission.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Tap Back to return to the Share Folder screen, and tap the app
through which you want to send your invitation (Messages below).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Enter the name of your recipient or pick them from your contacts
list.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Enter a message to your recipient and send them the link to the
shared folder.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p><img alt="Blog Photo" src="https://grovetech.co/assets/img/blog/2021/20210401Tr/image6.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded m-2" width="700" /></p>

<p>Managing a shared folder in the Files app is similar. Once you press and
hold on an already shared folder and tap Manage Shared Folder in the
Share sheet, you can do the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Tap Share Options to change Who Can Access and Permissions options,
or to copy the link to the shared folder.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Tap a person‚Äôs name to change their permissions or remove access
entirely.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Tap Stop Sharing to stop sharing the folder.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>One final tip. Although iCloud Drive generally works well, we‚Äôve
occasionally seen it get stuck syncing on the Mac. You may see files or
folders fail to sync between devices or have a file or folder
permanently display the little cloud icon in the Finder that indicates
iCloud Drive is updating. To resolve such problems and reset the local
state of iCloud Drive, first make a copy of any critical files to the
desktop, just in case. Then open System Preferences &gt; Apple ID &gt;
iCloud, deselect iCloud Drive, click Remove from Mac when prompted, and
then select iCloud Drive again. Give it some time to resync with iCloud
and download new copies of your files.</p>
