<p>Organizations are faced with the increasing scrutiny of more complex and sophisticated attacks by threat actors against key information systems that are essential to the organization.  Complex attacks such as ransomware and data exfiltration are being used against organizations or systems that they encounter or somehow get access to.  When an attacker wants to break into a system, they will typically choose the easiest and most direct methods in means in order to access it.
