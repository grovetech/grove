<hr />

<p>Unless you can palm a basketball, you may not be able to use an iPhone
single-handed. But sometimes one hand is all you can spare. If you find
yourself in such a situation, give Reachability a try. On a Touch
ID–based iPhone, tap (don’t press) the Home button twice to slide the
iPhone’s interface halfway down the physical screen, bringing everything
into reach of your thumb. On the Face ID–equipped iPhone X, put your
thumb in the bottom of the screen—about at the top edge of the Dock if
you were on the Home screen—and swipe down. You can use apps normally
for a tap or two, and then they’ll expand back to the full screen to
show the full interface. If Reachability is off (or if you want to turn
it off), go to Settings &gt; General &gt; Accessibility.</p>
