<p>Remember the heady dotcom days, when businesses were desperate to get a
short, memorable, easily typed .com domain? It quickly became difficult
to get what you wantedâ€”so much so that deep-pocketed companies paid
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_most_expensive_domain_names">exorbitant
sums</a>
for just the right domain.</p>

<p>Before we go any further, letâ€™s make sure weâ€™re all on the same page.
Domain names are necessary because computers on the Internet are all
identified by inscrutable numeric IP addresses. You can remember and
type apple.com easily; 184.31.17.21 not so much. Domain names have two
or more parts: the top-level domain (read from the end, such as com) and
the second-level domain (like apple), plus optional third-level domains
(which could give you support.apple.com).</p>

<p>Since the days of speculating in .com domains, however, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Internet_top-level_domains">hundreds of
additional top-level
domains</a>
have been opened up, including domains from .aaa to .zone. There are now
top-level domains for .doctor, .florist, .lawyer, and many more,
including the general .xyz. It might be tempting to switch from the
awkward dewey-cheatham-howe.com to the shorter and more memorable
dch.lawyer. And even if there isnâ€™t a profession-specific top-level
domain that works for you, you may think that if abc.xyz is good enough
for Googleâ€™s parent company Alphabet, surely itâ€™s good enough for you.</p>

<p>Alas, much as we appreciate the creativity and flexibility offered by
these alternative top-level domains, weâ€™d like to dissuade you from
using one, if possible. Problems include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Email deliverability:</strong> If youâ€™re sending email using an
alternative top-level domain or including links to that domain, itâ€™s
much more likely that your email will be considered spam by
receiving systems.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>SMS deliverability:</strong> Some SMS text message providers will
automatically delete messages containing URLs with alternative
top-level domains in an effort to protect their customers from
phishing attacks.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Social media spam filtering:</strong> As with SMS text messages, social
media posts that include URLs with alternative top-level domains may
be categorized as spam or as linking to a malicious site.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Firewall blocking:</strong> <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2018/06/bad-men-at-work-please-dont-click/">Abuse of alternative top-level
domains</a>
has become so commonplace by scammers that some companies prevent
their employees from accessing websites using certain alternative
top-level domains at the firewall level.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>User perception:</strong> Although thereâ€™s no telling how anyone will
react to a particular top-level domain, people wonâ€™t think twice
about .com but might think .ooo seems sketchy. (We would.)</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Obviously, it may not be possible to get the domain name you want in
.com. What to do? There are a few strategies:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Expand or abbreviate:</strong> At this time, people mostly donâ€™t see,
remember, or type domains apart from those that go with businesses
that do a lot of real-world advertising. So if you need to add or
subtract words (or letters) in your domain to find a unique one,
that can work.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Use a country domain:</strong> Two-letter top-level domains are
restricted for use by countries, so .us is for the United States,
.ca for Canada, and .au for Australia. Every country has different
rules for who can register them. For instance, itâ€™s possible to get
a domain ending in .it (Italy) as long as you work through a
registrar that acts as your representative there. .io (British
Indian Ocean Territory) and .ai (Anguilla) are popular top-level
domains among tech companies.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Stick with better, pricier alternatives:</strong> Not all alternative
top-level domains are equally problematic. The classic .net and .org
are fine, and .biz isnâ€™t bad. But how to determine that? When youâ€™re
checking to see if a domain name is available, compare prices. For
instance, at one domain name registrar, iphonewhisperer.xyz costs
only $1 per year, whereas the iphonewhisperer.biz version is $4.98
per year, iphonewhisperer.net is $9.18 per year, and
iphonewhisperer.studio is $11.98 per year. The more you pay, the
less likely that domain has been abused by spammers and marked for
filtering.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>In the end, when it comes to domain names, itâ€™s best to be conservative
and stick with a top-level domain that wonâ€™t cause people or filters to
think twice. Thatâ€™s probably .com, if you can make the rest of the name
work for you.</p>
