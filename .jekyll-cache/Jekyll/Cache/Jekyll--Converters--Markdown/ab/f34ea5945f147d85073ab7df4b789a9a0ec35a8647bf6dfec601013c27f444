I"«<p>Many of us have been using iPhones for years, and apps we bought or
downloaded long ago molder in corners of our Home screens. Even if you
havenâ€™t played Flappy Bird in years, its pixelated icon still stares
glumly at you every time you peer at its Home screen, and itâ€™s far from
alone. To find out how many apps you have, go to Settings &gt; General &gt;
About and look next to Applications. So where are they all?</p>
