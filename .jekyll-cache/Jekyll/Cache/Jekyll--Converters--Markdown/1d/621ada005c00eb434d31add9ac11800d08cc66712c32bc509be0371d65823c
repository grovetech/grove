I"Ú<p>You probably fall into one of two camps: people who havenâ€™t the foggiest
idea what pressing Command-Shift-3 or Command-Shift-4 do on the Mac, and
those who use those keyboard shortcuts regularly to take screenshots.
Either way, macOS 10.14 Mojave makes it easier than ever to create a
still image of whatâ€™s on your Macâ€™s screen and to record a video of
actions you take on the screen. (And donâ€™t worry, the old shortcuts
still work just as they always have.)</p>
