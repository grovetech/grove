I"X<p>As vaccination rates climb, many businesses are starting to think about
reopening their offices and bringing back employees who have been
working from home for the last year. That’s a big decision that will
undoubtedly vary from company to company, but we’d like to suggest a few
things to consider. Please contact us early in such deliberations so we
can provide guidance before problems crop up.​</p>

<h3 id="full-return-or-hybrid-model">Full Return or Hybrid Model?</h3>

<p>Perhaps the biggest question firms will have to answer is if they’ll
require all employees to return or if some can continue to work
remotely. Many organizations have discovered that physical presence
isn’t as important as they thought it was. In a post-pandemic world,
many employees may prefer to continue working from home if they can, at
least for a while.</p>

<p>If you decide on a hybrid model, you’ll want to put some thought into
what technology you’ll need to enable hybrid meetings, with some people
connecting remotely via videoconferencing software and others gathering
in person. Large screens, specially mounted cameras, and dedicated
speakerphone hardware may be necessary to conduct a hybrid meeting
effectively.</p>

<p>With some workers remaining at home, it will also be important to ensure
that everyone has appropriate access to on-premises servers. Obviously,
that has been a problem for the last year as well, but it may be
tempting to revert to old approaches upon reopening an office. That may
not be effective in a new hybrid workplace, so check with us on
cloud-based alternatives that could work better in the new world order.​</p>

<h3 id="consider-your-physical-space">Consider Your Physical Space</h3>

<p>Particularly if you do decide on a hybrid model, it’s worth evaluating
whether you need the same amount and type of space as you did before.
There’s no single answer here. You don’t want to downsize your physical
space only to discover in a few months that some of those employees who
swore that they never wanted to come back feel that they’re missing out.
Simultaneously, if your offices are a warren of small, poorly ventilated
rooms, employees may be even more hesitant about returning.</p>

<p>Plus, your physical space is inherently related to your IT
infrastructure, so don’t ignore the costs surrounding an office move. A
new space might require pulling new Ethernet cables, testing Wi-Fi
signal strength to ensure sufficient coverage, evaluating the
cleanliness of the electrical power, and more.</p>

<p>We don’t mean to dissuade you from moving offices if that’s what makes
the most sense for the future of your company, but talk to us before
signing any new leases so we can help identify and head off any
technical problems with the physical plant.</p>

<p>Finally, this isn’t related to IT, but if your existing office space has
been entirely vacant for the last year, it’s worth reading the
information that the Centers for Disease Control puts out to help
employers create <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/office-buildings.html">safe and healthy
workplaces</a>.
Buildings don’t do well with prolonged shutdowns.​</p>

<h3 id="does-network-infrastructure-need-updating">Does Network Infrastructure Need Updating?</h3>

<p>Before you bring employees back, at least en masse, it’s also worth
touching base with us about your IT infrastructure. If you’ve been
limping along with sketchy Ethernet cabling, or if you have dirty power
that could be damaging your Macs and peripherals, it’s a great time to
consider addressing such problems. Pre-pandemic, attempting to install
new electrical circuits or pull new network cabling might have been too
disruptive, but with an office that’s empty or nearly so, such work can
be done more quickly and cheaply.</p>

<p>Similarly, this could be a good time to replace aging computers,
printers, or even phone systems. Such infrastructure upgrades and
transitions can cause interruptions in normal times, but if you’re
bringing people back, wouldn’t it be nice to have the office provide a
better IT experience than it did before?</p>
