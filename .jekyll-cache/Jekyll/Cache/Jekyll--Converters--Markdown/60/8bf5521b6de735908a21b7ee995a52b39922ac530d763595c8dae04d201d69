I"À<p>You likely know that you can use Do Not Disturb to prevent random
notifications on your iPhone from waking you at nightâ€”itâ€™s easy to set
a Do Not Disturb schedule for your usual sleeping hours. Another setting
in there is important but often overlooked. If you ever use your iPhone
during those Do Not Disturb hoursâ€”perhaps to read a book while a
partner or roommate is asleepâ€”you donâ€™t want it to make any noise. To
prevent that, in Settings &gt; Do Not Disturb, make sure to set Silence to
Always instead of While iPhone Is Locked.</p>
