I"ì<p>It can be easy to become overwhelmed by iOS notifications, particularly
if you have chatty friends or apps. In iOS 12, Apple corralled
notifications by grouping them into stacks so you no longer see an
endless screen of alerts. To expand a stack of notifications on either
the Lock screen or in Notification Center (swipe down from the top of
the screen), tap the stack. Once youâ€™ve expanded a stack, you can tap
Show Less to restack it, tap the X button to remove the entire stack, or
tap any individual notification to open it. By default, iOS 12 groups
notifications intelligently, which might entail separate stacks for
different Messages conversations, for instance. If thatâ€™s still too
much, you can go to Settings &gt; Notifications &gt; <em>App Name</em> &gt;
Notification Grouping and tap By App to collect every notification from
the app into the same stack.</p>
