I"¨<p>When Apple introduced the 12-inch MacBook in April 2015, the machine was
the thinnest Mac ever, with a tapered design that starts at a mere 3.5
mm and grows only to 13.1 mm. A change from previous laptop models that
made such an incredibly thin design possible was a new keyboard that
swapped a scissor-style switch under each key for a new ‚Äúbutterfly
mechanism‚Äù that‚Äôs 40 percent thinner.</p>

<p>In October 2016, Apple started using a second generation of the
so-called ‚Äúbutterfly‚Äù keyboard in the MacBook Pro line. Then, in July
2018, Apple updated the keyboard to a third-generation design that added
a thin silicone membrane under each key to protect from dust and other
foreign objects. That third-generation keyboard made its way into the
MacBook Air released in October 2018. Then, in May 2019, Apple once
again updated the keyboard in the latest models of the MacBook Pro,
telling journalists that the fourth-generation design has a ‚Äúmaterials
change‚Äù in the mechanism.</p>

<p>Why has Apple kept tinkering with the butterfly keyboard? Put frankly,
because it has had problems. Although there are no independent estimates
of what percentage of Macs equipped with butterfly keyboards are
afflicted, many users have complained about keys sticking or feeling
crunchy, keys failing to fire at all (so no letter is typed when the key
is pressed), and keys repeating (so multiple letters are typed per
keypress).</p>

<p>In fact, in June 2018, just before the third-generation design appeared
in the MacBook Pro, Apple acknowledged that ‚Äúa small percentage‚Äù of
first- and second-generation butterfly keyboards were affected and
launched a repair program to fix them for free, even if they were out of
warranty. (The fact that a class-action suit surrounding the butterfly
keyboards was filed against Apple in May 2018 might have been related.)</p>

<p>Alas, the silicone membrane didn‚Äôt resolve all the issues, and after the
E and R keys on her MacBook Pro failed, influential tech journalist
Joanna Stern of the Wall Street Journal wrote a hilarious column
entitled ‚ÄúAppl Still Hasn‚Äôt Fixd Its MacBook Kyboad Problm,‚Äù complete
with interactive switches so you could read it with or without the
various missing and duplicated letters. Plus, a repair technician <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/bjtyaw/macbook_pro_keyboard_failures_why_apples_dust/" rel="nofollow">tore
down a MacBook Pro
keyboard</a>
to show why he didn‚Äôt think dust was an issue. Apple apologized to the
Wall Street Journal, saying:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>We are aware that a small number of users are having issues with their
third-generation butterfly keyboard and for that we are sorry. The
vast majority of Mac notebook customers are having a positive
experience with the new keyboard.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So when Apple released the fourth-generation butterfly keyboard with the
current MacBook Pro models, the company also extended the <a href="https://www.apple.com/support/keyboard-service-program-for-mac-notebooks/" rel="nofollow">Keyboard
Service Program for MacBook, MacBook Air, and MacBook
Pro</a>
to cover the third-generation keyboards. The repair program lists the
exact models that are covered, but it basically comes down to any
12-inch MacBook, MacBook Air models released in late 2018, and MacBook
Pro models starting in 2016 and up to 2019.</p>

<p>What‚Äôs the practical upshot of all this for you?</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>If you have a MacBook, MacBook Air, or MacBook Pro with one of these
butterfly keyboards, and it‚Äôs working properly, that‚Äôs great! Do
nothing‚Äîhopefully it will keep tip, tap, typing away.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If you have one of those Macs and are having problems, contact Apple
or an Apple Authorized Service Provider for a repair. <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT209095" rel="nofollow">Before you
hand over any Mac for
repair</a>, make sure you
have at least one and preferably two backups of your data, since
Apple sometimes replaces storage devices while doing seemingly
unrelated repairs.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If you already paid Apple to have your butterfly keyboard repaired,
<a href="https://getsupport.apple.com/?PRKEYS=PF2&amp;category_id=SC0998&amp;symptom_id=99980&amp;caller=erep" rel="nofollow">contact Apple to request a
refund</a>.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>It‚Äôs too soon to know if the fourth-generation butterfly keyboard will
resolve all the complaints, but whenever we‚Äôre not typing, our fingers
are crossed.</p>
