I"Ï<p>Let me preface this article by saying that Munki is an open source tool that allows system administrators trying to take hold of their Macintosh environment with little to no budget. Munki is a tool that was developed by a systems administrator over at Disney Animation Studioâ€™s. It is now used by small companies and large alike (Disney &amp; Google). Now its also true that both of these giantâ€™s also use Casper a top shelf product by JAMF software.</p>
