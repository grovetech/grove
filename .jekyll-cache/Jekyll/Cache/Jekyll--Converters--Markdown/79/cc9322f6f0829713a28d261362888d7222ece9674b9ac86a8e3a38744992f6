<hr />
<p>As we explored <a href="https://grovetech.co/blog/iphone-8-and-iphone-x/">pre-launch</a>, Apple introduced new facial recognition code, internally referred to as Pearl, in the new OLED iPhone X. This facial software operates via a combination of 3D sensors that generate a 3D map of the face. After you go through the process of setting up your face recognition through a series of photos holding the camera facing you, Apple‚Äôs software uses this information along with sophisticated machine learning via its A11 Bionic neural engine.</p>

<p>Regardless of whether you wear a hat, glasses, have facial hair or makeup or change your hairstyle, the facial recognition software on your iPhone will continue to recognize and identify you, according to Apple.</p>

<p>The phone will not unlock if the user is not facing the phone or has eyes closed.</p>

<p>4G LTE radios provide connectivity. The iPhone X has 802.11ac wi-fi and Bluetooth 5.0. The iPhone X also has a Lightning port that charges quickly. You can also now charge up the iPhone X wirelessly charged via an open Qi protocol.</p>

<p>Apple also shared a preview of its new multi-device charging device called AirPower, which acts as a charging pad for the iPhone X, Apple Watch Series 3 and AirPods. The new charger will ship in early 2018.</p>

<h3 id="stunning-color-accuracy">Stunning Color Accuracy</h3>
<hr />
<p>The new iPhone X offers a high quality OLED screen unlike any other smartphone, akin to prior iPhones with stunning color accuracy, vivid brightness, true colors and a 1,000,000 to 1 contrast ratio.</p>

<h3 id="advanced-camera-system">Advanced Camera System</h3>
<hr />
<p>The new camera system includes a 12 Megapixel rear camera and a vertical dual-camera array similar to that in the iPhone 7 Plus. The camera also has dual optical image stabilization instead of just one one lens, and quad-LED True Tone flash.</p>

<h3 id="faster-new-gestures">Faster, New Gestures</h3>
<hr />
<p>In the new iPhone X, there isn‚Äôt a home button so you swipe up from the bottom of the screen instead. If you want to open the multitasking menu instead, just pause for a split-second. If you swipe down from the top of the screen, you‚Äôll get either Control Center or Notifications, depending upon the side that you swipe from.</p>

<p>There are 2 models available currently - a $999 model for 64GB of storage, and a 256GB model listed at $1149. Color options include silver or space gray. Pre-orders begin Oct 27 and first devices are expected to ship Nov 3.</p>
