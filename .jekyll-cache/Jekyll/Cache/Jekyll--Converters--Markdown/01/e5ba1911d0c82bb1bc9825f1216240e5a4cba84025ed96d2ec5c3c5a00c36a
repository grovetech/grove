<hr />

<p>Productivity experts recommend offloading things you have to remember to
a task-management app like Apple’s Reminders, which syncs your to-dos
among your Mac, iPhone, iPad, and Apple Watch. That’s particularly
helpful for tasks you want to be reminded of in a few months or next
year, but then those far-in-the-future tasks—especially repeating
ones!—clutter your main Reminders list. The solution? Create a Far
Future Reminders list, and move reminders to it that aren’t relevant
within the next month or so. Just make sure everything in Far Future
Reminders is set to alert you on the appropriate day.</p>
