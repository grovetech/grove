I"ä<p>It seems no matter how careful Apple is each OS update (especially server updates) reveals its own challenges for the user, that leaves them wishing that they had not left their stable platform for the bug fixes that made that update so desirable. the 10.6.8 server update was no different it claimed to fix such long time bugs as Server Side Rules which has been a thorn in the side of OSX Server Administrators everywhere who use OSX Servers as their primary email server. So many of us including myself, downloaded the update and wished for the best. Once done, we all noticed the same bug, extremely high CPU usage on XServes running the new 10.6.8 software and the culprit, hwmond. Hey, hwmond, you are supposed to monitor the hard drives in the XServe and not hog all the resources what gives? Was my initial reaction so I started Googling I found that the hwmond was a service that Apple launches to monitor hardware, it can not be unloaded easily like other launch daemons I ranÂ </p>
