I"Ğ<p>Weâ€™ve all had it happen. â€œCan I use your Mac for a minute to check my
email?â€ The answer can be â€œYes,â€ but to keep people from poking around
on your Mac, have your visitor log in as Guest. To enable the Guest
account, go to System Preferences &gt; Users &amp; Groups. If the lock at the
bottom left is closed, click it and enter your admin credentials. Then
click Guest User in the list, and select â€œAllow guests to log in to this
computer.â€ To switch to the Guest account, go to the Apple menu and
choose Log Out <em>YourAccountName</em> to access the login screen. Your guest
can then click the Guest User icon, at which point theyâ€™ll have a clean
account to work in. When they log out, the accountâ€”including any files
they created or downloadedâ€”will be deleted, thus protecting their
privacy as well.</p>
