I"<p>With macOS 10.14 Mojave, Apple has beefed up the Mac’s privacy so it
more closely resembles privacy in iOS. You’ve noticed that when you
launch a new app on your iPhone or iPad, it often prompts for access to
your photos or contacts, the camera or microphone, and more. The idea
behind those prompts is that you should always be aware of how a
particular app can access your personal data or features of your device.
You might not want to let some new game thumb through your photos or
record your voice.</p>
