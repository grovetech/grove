<hr />

<p>Photos on the Mac provides so many editing tools that it’s easy to lose
track of how an edited image compares to the original. You can always
use the Revert to Original command and then undo it, but that’s fussy.
Instead, Photos provides a Show Original button in the upper-left corner, between
the window controls and the Revert to Original button. Click and hold it
to see your original image; let up to see the edited version again. Even
easier, press the M key on your keyboard. The only thing either of those
techniques won’t do is show the effect of cropping; to see the uncropped
original, press Control-M. And if you just want to see how a particular
set of adjustment controls affected the image, click its blue checkmark
to turn it off and back on.</p>
