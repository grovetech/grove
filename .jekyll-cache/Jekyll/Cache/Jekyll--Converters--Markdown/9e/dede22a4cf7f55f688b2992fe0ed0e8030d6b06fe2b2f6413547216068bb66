I"å<p>Snow Leopard 10.6 comes with built in Server Side rules (Sieve) that helps you to organize mail, if your like me and am supremely disappointed at the lack of functionality then you will be happy to know that there are alternatives out there. Snow Leopard still ships with a copy of Squirrel mail for OSX it also ships with many cool plugins for squirrel mail already installed. Lets look at the alternative to the built in Sieve scripts that ship with 10.6 Snow Leopard server.</p>
