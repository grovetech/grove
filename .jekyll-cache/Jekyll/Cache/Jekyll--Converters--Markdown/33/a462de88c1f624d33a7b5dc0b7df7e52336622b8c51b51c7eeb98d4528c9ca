<p>We want to take a moment to recognize the 1 year workiversary of Parrish Knight. Parrish joined us with the hopes to help us grow our remote support base for small to startup sized companies. Unfortunately 2020 dealt us a blow and we did not grow as much in that sector as we had hoped. Regardless Parrish pitched in and stuck with us throughout the year and for that we are extremely grateful.</p>

<p>His attention to detail and ability to work across multiple sectors is impressive and his attentive demeanor and customer first approach to customer service makes him a wonderful addition to our team. Lets take a moment to learn a little bit more about Parrish and how he came to be here at Grove!</p>

  <p>I originally found Grove when they placed an advertisement on one of the job boards.

I often talk with the other techs about the tools we use for our job and so on.</p>
