I"O<p>For some time now Mac users have often opted for an iMac with all the upgrades for their workstation rather than the Mac Pro since it’s latest re-incarnation in the “dustbin” case has been shunned for it’s lack of upgradeability.</p>

<p>Apple has caught onto this fact and has promised to revamp the Mac Pro line (watch this space), in the meantime Apple has decided to launch the iMac Pro range due to launch later this year in December.</p>

<p>The iMac Pro Range will offer upto 128GB of RAM and up to 18 cores with a The Radeon Pro Vega GPU with up to 16GB of video RAM.</p>
