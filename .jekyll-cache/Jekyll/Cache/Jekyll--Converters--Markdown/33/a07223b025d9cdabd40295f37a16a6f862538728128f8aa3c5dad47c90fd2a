I"Â<p>If you own an iPhone or an iPad you will be well aware of the limitations of your device when it comes to storage and the quantity of data that you are trying to store on it. To make it simpler the iPhone and iPad now have great quality cameras, and it takes a lot of drive space to store these high quality images and videos. Hopefully the new standards (HEVC and HEIF) being adopted with better compression will go some way to resolve this.</p>
