I"™<p>Do you sometimes find it difficult to read articles on your iPhone
because of ads, banners, extraneous layout, social media icons, and
too-small fonts? We certainly do, and thereâ€™s often a quick fix for the
myriad ills of modern Web pages: Safari Reader. Whenever you see the
Safari Reader icon to the left of the siteâ€™s domain name in the
address bar, tap it to switch to a cleaner view that dispenses with all
the unnecessary trimmings and presents the content in a larger, more
readable font. Tap the font icon at the right side of the address
bar in Safari Reader to change the font, font size, and background
color. Safari Reader isnâ€™t always available, and it can occasionally
fail to format an article properly, but itâ€™s a big win when you can use
it.</p>
