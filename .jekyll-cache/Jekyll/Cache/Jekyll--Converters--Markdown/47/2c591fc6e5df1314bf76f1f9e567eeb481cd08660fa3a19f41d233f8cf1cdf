I"¦<p>Well it was not easy for me to do, however I must say it was a fun ride while it lasted. From early 2008 â€“ 2009 I hosted a Mac OSX Dashboard widget related podcast that went into the creation, design and coding of dashboard widgets. The podcast can be found <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/the-flip-side/id111529683">here</a> on iTunes for those interested in subscribing or listening to the shows.</p>
