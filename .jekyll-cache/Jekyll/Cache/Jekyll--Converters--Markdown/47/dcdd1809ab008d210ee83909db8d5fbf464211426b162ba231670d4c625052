I"á<p>Washington, DC: Grove Technologies today announced free cybersecurity training, an engaging online video-based training program. The robust cybersecurity training program is designed to educate employees on common threats to their organization‚Äôs cybersecurity and offers a new way for small to medium-sized businesses to educate their employees on cybersecurity risks and best practices amid the coronavirus pandemic, right from their home.</p>

<p>As many organizations have been forced to begin operating from a remote work environment, more employees than ever before have started working from home. The problem with this is that working remotely poses new cybersecurity risks to organizations that they likely have not dealt with up until now. Cybercriminals are diligently working to take advantage of these changes, hoping that employees will let their guard down or slip up by continuing to practice poor cyber hygiene in an environment that has many risks that are often overlooked.</p>

<p>‚ÄúMany small business owners don‚Äôt realize the impact of their employees working from home. Having them change their default Wi-Fi password is an important step but an overly technical one for many of our remote staff,‚Äù says Jon Brown, CEO at Grove Technologies. ‚ÄúMaking sure that remote staff have the support they need from an IT perspective keeps them happy and productive. Working remotely has its perks, but also comes with distractions and risks. We‚Äôre seeing a huge rise in COVID-19 scams which can pose a major risk to the security of our local businesses. That‚Äôs why we‚Äôre rolling out free cybersecurity training to any organization that wants it. Whether you‚Äôre a current customer or not, we want to make sure your employees have some knowledge of how to protect your business. Right now, all that matters to us is coming together to protect our community.‚Äù</p>

<p>Features and benefits of the free cybersecurity training include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Engaging, video-based training program accessible from anywhere</li>
  <li>Best practices for avoiding scams and protecting sensitive data</li>
  <li>Training quiz to test employee knowledge with a certificate of completion</li>
