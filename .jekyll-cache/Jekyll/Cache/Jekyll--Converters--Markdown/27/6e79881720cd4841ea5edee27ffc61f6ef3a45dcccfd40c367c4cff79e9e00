I"¼<p>Apple has recently released fixes for older Macs running macOS Sierra and OS X El Capitan that also face critical vulnerabilities through the Meltdown and Spectre security flaws.</p>

<p>Both Spectre and Meltdown allow attackers to gain unauthorized access to data on computers that have microprocessors running speculative execution. Modern micropro-cessors all use speculative execution to predict next steps and have faster processing speeds. This is common in chips made by Intel and AMD as well as Appleâ€™s A series SoCs.</p>

<p>If the predicted path is not required, the instruction set is canceled and the memory cache discarded in a process that is meant to function seamlessly and be invisible to users. Researchers however found that you could access targeted areas within a memory cache, thus unfortunately opening the door to accessing user passwords and thus a ton of sensitive data.</p>

<p>How do you combat the Meltdown and Spectre security flaw if you have an older Mac?</p>
