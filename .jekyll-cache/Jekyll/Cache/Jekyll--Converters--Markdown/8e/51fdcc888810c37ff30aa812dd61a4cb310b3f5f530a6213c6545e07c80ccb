<p>Apple has announced the iMac Pro will be available to order on the 14th of December 2017.</p>

<p>Here at Grove Technologies we already announced the iMac Pro providing a run down the specs back in June of <a href="https://grovetech.co/blog/imac-pro-announced-2017/">this year.</a></p>

<p>The iMac Pro will start from $4,999 which sounds high but it would be no cheaper to build a Windows PC with the same specs! As of today’s announcement the only real downside we can see is that the iMac Pro will lack upgradeability, including the Memory as the opening a the bottom of the current iMac’s is gone with the iMac Pro’s.</p>

<p>Jonathan Morrison &amp; Marques Brownlee each had a 10-core iMac Pro to review for this last week. Both achieved a Geekbench score of over 37,400 which means these new iMac Pro’s are 45 percent faster than the top-end 2013 Mac Pro.</p>

<p>These new iMac Pro’s will be available with 8-, 10-, or 18-core Xeon processors; However Marques Brownlee said only 8 &amp; 10 core models will be available to order from the 14th of December.</p>
