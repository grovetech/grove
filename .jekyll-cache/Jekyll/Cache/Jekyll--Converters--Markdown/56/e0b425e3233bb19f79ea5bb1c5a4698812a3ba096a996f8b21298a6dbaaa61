<hr />

<p>Appleâ€™s Photos app on the Mac can identify thousands of different
objects in your photos, so itâ€™s easy to find photos based on their
content. You can find objects (cars and trains), scenery (beaches and
forests), and even some events (weddings and parades). This is both big
fun and useful for those times when you canâ€™t remember when you took a
photo, but do remember whatâ€™s in it, like a cat, camera, or carousel. To
carry out a search like this, type the search term into the Search field
on the right side of the Photos toolbar. From the list that appears,
choose the Category result. In macOS 10.13 High Sierraâ€™s version of
Photos, you can filter your results from the Showing menu at the upper
right of the window. The feature isnâ€™t perfect, so you may see some odd
results or miss some photos, but itâ€™s way faster than browsing manually!</p>
