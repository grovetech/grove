I"Á<p>In 2016, Apple introduced the Touch Bar with the MacBook Pro. Itâ€™s a
long, thin display above the number keys on the keyboard that shows a
variety of buttons and controls. By default, it changes depending on
which app youâ€™re in, and it also displays the Control Strip, a
collection of controls that roughly mimics the functions accessible from
the F-keys that traditionally live in that position. Finally, it
includes the Touch ID sensor that brings fingerprint authentication to
the Mac.</p>

<p>Since its launch, however, the Touch Bar hasnâ€™t migrated to any other
Macs or keyboards, although the MacBook Air picked up a Touch ID sensor
without the rest of the Touch Bar. As a result, developers havenâ€™t been
as enthusiastic about supporting the Touch Bar as they might have been.
Nevertheless, it provides useful shortcuts in many apps, and you can
customize it more to your liking. (Plus, although weâ€™re not going into
those details here, Apple is making the Touch Bar even more useful and
customizable in macOS 11 Big Sur.)â€‹</p>

<p><strong>Choose What the Touch Bar Shows</strong></p>

<p>You may never have noticed the Touch Barâ€™s settings because Apple has
hidden them in the Keyboard pane of System Preferences. Logical, but
perhaps not where you might have looked first if you were thinking of
the Touch Bar as an extension of the trackpad.</p>

<p>You have two choices here, what appears in the Touch Bar normally, and
how it changes if you press the Fn key in the lower-left corner of the
keyboard. Your options include:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>App Controls:</strong> The controls that appear when
you choose this option vary by app. This option is the most
generally useful, though how much so depends on whether the apps you
use support the Touch Bar in helpful ways.</li>
  <li><strong>Expanded Control Strip:</strong> The Control Strip,
which appears by default on the right side of the Touch Bar, lets
you adjust common settings like brightness and volume. The Expanded
Control Strip option fills the rest of the Touch Bar with more
buttons.</li>
  <li><strong>F1, F2, etc. Keys:</strong> Aimed at keyboard
traditionalists, this option mimics the F-keys that occupy the Touch
Barâ€™s position on every other keyboard in the universe. People often
use these keys as hot keys with macro programs like <a href="https://www.keyboardmaestro.com/">Keyboard
Maestro</a>.</li>
  <li><strong>Quick Actions:</strong> Want to create your own
custom buttons for the Touch Bar? In Appleâ€™s
<a href="https://support.apple.com/guide/automator/welcome/mac">Automator</a>
app, you can create workflows as Quick Actions, which then appear on
the Touch Bar when you choose this option.</li>
  <li><strong>Spaces:</strong> Those who are big users of Spaces
in Mission Control might appreciate this option, which lets you
switch between different full-screen apps and Split View spaces.</li>
</ul>

<p>In the Touch Bar Shows pop-up menu, you should choose the set of Touch
Bar buttons that youâ€™ll find the most useful most of the time. Thatâ€™s
probably either App Controls or F-keys for most people, unless you do a
lot of your own automation (choose Quick Actions) or regularly use
full-screen apps (choose Spaces).</p>

<p>The Press Fn Key To menu basically gives you a second choiceâ€”press
that key, and you can display whatever set of buttons youâ€™d find next
most useful.</p>

<p>Finally, notice that thereâ€™s a checkbox for Show Control Strip. If you
want to take over its space on the right side of the Touch Bar for other
buttons, deselect the checkbox. One useful approach is to disable the
Control Strip in general use, but show the expanded Control Strip when
you press Fn. â€‹</p>

<p><strong>Customize App Controls</strong></p>

<p>App controls are in many ways the most interesting because they change
not just when you switch between apps, but also based on what youâ€™re
doing in an app. Take Pages, for instance. If youâ€™re working with text,
Pages configures the Touch Bar to show buttons that let you switch
between paragraph styles, apply character formatting, and tweak
horizontal and vertical justification. That button on the far right
displays auto-complete options for the word youâ€™re typing. But if you
have a text box selected, Pages instead provides buttons for opacity,
various colors, and line strokes. Select a table, and Pages immediately
offers options for adding and removing columns and rows.</p>

<p>Even better, some apps, like Safari, let you pick which buttons appear
in the Touch Bar, just as you can pick the controls that appear in
window toolbars. In apps that allow this, choose View &gt; Customize Touch
Bar. A selection of available buttons appears at the bottom of the
screen. Drag one of the buttons off the bottom of the screen
andâ€”really!â€”onto the Touch Bar, where you can drag it into different
spots. When youâ€™re done, click the Done button.</p>

<p>While youâ€™re customizing the Touch Bar for an app, you can also
rearrange buttons by dragging them left or right (with either the
pointer or your finger) and remove buttons by dragging them (with the
pointer) from the Touch Bar to the MacBook Proâ€™s screen.</p>

<p>Note that the Touch Bar is only so big, and the Mac wonâ€™t let you
populate it with more buttons than it has room for. If you try, the new
button will replace one of the current buttons.â€‹</p>

<p><strong>Customize the Control Strip</strong></p>

<p>Youâ€™re not limited to choosing which app controls youâ€™d like to see in
the Touch Bar. In System Preferences &gt; Keyboard &gt; Keyboard, click
Customize Control Strip to bring up a similar collection of controls
that you can add to the Control Strip. Plus, you can rearrange and
remove buttons from the Touch Barâ€™s Control Strip just as with the app
controls.</p>

<p><strong>Try Third-Party Utilities</strong></p>

<p>As you might expect, clever Mac programmers have extended the ways you
can use the Touch Bar beyond what Apple provides. Here are a few of our
favorites:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://folivora.ai/"><strong>BetterTouchTool</strong></a><strong>:</strong>
For $8.50, this general-purpose customization utility gives you
control over various input devices on your Mac, including the Touch
Bar. It lets you completely customize the Touch Bar, add and
customize the appearance of buttons for all sorts of built-in
actions, create dynamic widgets using AppleScript and other
languages, and download ready-to-use presets.</li>
  <li><a href="https://pock.dev/"><strong>Pock</strong></a><strong>:</strong> Want
to recover the screen real-estate occupied by the Dock? The free
Pock puts your Dock items in the Touch Bar for fast app switching.
Plus, it provides useful widgets, including a handy Now Playing
widget that can show the title of the current song.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.haptictouchbar.com/"><strong>Haptic Touch
Bar</strong></a><strong>:</strong> Although Apple
built the Touch Bar so it could provide haptic feedbackâ€”making it
feel like youâ€™ve pressed a key down when all youâ€™ve done is touched
a flat glass surfaceâ€”most controls donâ€™t provide it. The $4.99
Haptic Touch Bar utility makes all Touch Bar buttons pretend to be
physical buttons, with haptic and audio feedback.</li>
</ul>

<p>If youâ€™ve been ignoring the Touch Bar because it didnâ€™t work the way you
wanted, or if youâ€™ve liked using it but wished it could do more, give
these customization options a try!</p>
