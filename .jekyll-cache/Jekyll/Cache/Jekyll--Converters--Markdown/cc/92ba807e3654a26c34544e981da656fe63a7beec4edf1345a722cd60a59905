I"Ö"<p>In cybercriminal circles, ransomware is all the rage. Once it has
infected a computer, it encrypts all the files and then presents a
ransom demand‚Äîpay up to get the decryption software necessary to
recover the data.</p>

<p>Ransomware has been in the news all year, with the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colonial_Pipeline_ransomware_attack">Colonial Pipeline
attack</a>
in particular spending weeks in the headlines. Attacks rose 485% in 2020
and show no signs of abating. The amounts demanded by the attackers are
increasing, too, with PC manufacturer
<a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/computer-giant-acer-hit-by-50-million-ransomware-attack/">Acer</a>
and Apple supplier Quanta both hit with $50 million demands. Worse,
some ransomware attackers are adding an extortion component where they
threaten to reveal confidential data if the victim doesn‚Äôt pay. It‚Äôs
scary, we know.</p>

<p>First, the good news. Although there are several examples of ransomware
that target the Mac, none of them have been particularly well done or
(as far as we know) successful. Right now, the chances of Macs falling
prey to ransomware are very low, and there‚Äôs no reason to panic.</p>

<p>However, complacency is dangerous. There‚Äôs a trend toward ‚Äúransomware as
a service‚Äù (RaaS). The RaaS operators maintain the ransomware malware,
offer a payment portal for victims, and provide ‚Äúcustomer service‚Äù for
victims who don‚Äôt know how to pay with Bitcoin or other
cryptocurrencies. Affiliates spread the ransomware and split the
revenues with the operators. It‚Äôs a tidy little cybercriminal
enterprise, and separating the malware development and network
penetration tasks has made it significantly easier for more criminals to
leverage ransomware. It‚Äôs only a matter of time before they turn their
attention to Macs.</p>

<p>For the most part, protecting your Macs from ransomware is no different
than protecting against any number of other security problems. Follow
this core advice:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Keep Macs and apps up to date:</strong> Always install macOS and security
updates, and keep other apps up to date. With every update, Apple
addresses numerous security vulnerabilities, fixing the vast
majority of them before attackers can exploit them with malware.
Every so often, however, Apple‚Äôs security notes include this
sentence: ‚ÄúApple is aware of a report that this issue may have been
actively exploited.‚Äù That means there may be malware that targets
that vulnerability; install such updates immediately!

  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Use strong passwords with a password manager:</strong> You‚Äôve heard it
from us before, and you‚Äôll hear it again, but it‚Äôs essential that
everyone in your organization use strong, unique passwords through a
password manager like <a href="https://1password.com/">1Password</a>,
<a href="https://www.lastpass.com/">LastPass</a>, or even Apple‚Äôs <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204085">iCloud
Keychain</a>. Just one weak
password could allow attackers to infiltrate a computer or server
and install ransomware.

  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Be suspicious of links and attachments:</strong> Ensure that everyone in
your organization is careful about opening attachments or clicking
links in email messages from unknown people or that seem off in some
way. Phishing attacks are one of the primary ways of distributing
malware. (If your group needs training in phishing awareness,
contact us.)

  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Never download pirated software!</strong> Even aside from the fact that
it‚Äôs ethically problematic, the most recent piece of Mac
ransomware‚ÄîThiefQuest‚Äîwas initially found in a malicious
installer purporting to be for the LittleSnitch network security
utility (ironic, eh?). Get apps only from the developers‚Äô official
sites or the Mac App Store.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Make frequent backups:</strong> Backups are essential so, even if you do
fall prey to ransomware, you can restore data from before the
infection point. The caveat is that some of your backups <em>must</em> be
isolated from the Macs in question‚Äîsome ransomware intentionally
tries to encrypt or delete connected backups.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Monitor for ransomware:</strong> Although ransomware usually tries to
stay below the radar while it‚Äôs encrypting files, the free
<a href="https://objective-see.com/products/ransomwhere.html">RansomWhere</a>
utility can identify processes that quickly create encrypted files.
It will likely incorrectly flag some legitimate behavior too (like
in the screenshot below), but it‚Äôs still a helpful tool.

  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Have anti-malware software:</strong> For the most part, if you‚Äôre careful
about following the advice above, you‚Äôll be fine. But it‚Äôs a good
idea to have a current anti-malware app around and run it
occasionally‚Äîif you don‚Äôt already have one, try the free version
of <a href="https://www.malwarebytes.com/">Malwarebytes</a>. If you‚Äîor your
users‚Äîaren‚Äôt good about the basic precautions, you might want to
run anti-malware software all the time or set up broader network
protections.  <br />

  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Have a disaster management plan:</strong> Every business should think
about how it would react to a fire, flood, earthquake, or other
disaster. When building a disaster management plan, be sure to
include ransomware. How would you shut down infected systems,
rebuild them from scratch, and restore uninfected files?</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Setting up a backup strategy that protects against ransomware requires a
little more thought. As noted, ransomware often tries to render backups
useless in one way or another. You need to have versioned backups that
allow you to restore from before the ransomware infection, and those
backups need to be isolated from the computers and network being backed
up. Techniques that help include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Isolate backup drives:</strong> Rotate multiple Time Machine drives, with
at least one that‚Äôs always disconnected. However, this strategy
assumes you‚Äôll detect a ransomware infection before you‚Äôve rotated
all the drives. Ransomware could lie undetected for weeks or months
before activating. Manually run current anti-malware software before
connecting any backup drive.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Use Internet backup:</strong> Set up an Internet backup system that will
maintain versions of backed-up files, such as
<a href="https://www.backblaze.com/">Backblaze</a> with its <a href="https://www.backblaze.com/version-history.html">Extended Version
History</a> feature.
<a href="https://www.retrospect.com/en/ransomware">Retrospect 18</a> also
supports object locking on cloud storage systems, which provides
<em>immutable storage</em>. It ensures that no one‚Äîeven someone who
acquires root credentials‚Äîcan delete the backups during the
retention period.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Consider tape backups:</strong> Long ago, tape backups were the go-to
solution for network backups, but as the price-per-gigabyte of hard
drives dropped precipitously and Internet backups became feasible,
tape has largely fallen by the wayside. But tape backups are still
an option. They can hold a lot of data and are easily kept offline
in a separate location. Plus, some tape drives can even operate in a
write-once, read-many (WORM) mode that guarantees data can‚Äôt be
erased or overwritten. Tape requires more human interaction than
other backup methods, but it‚Äôs still a cost-effective way to protect
hundreds of terabytes of data against ransomware.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Again, there‚Äôs no reason to panic about ransomware, but if it could
significantly damage your business, you should take steps to reduce the
chance of getting hit and ensure that you could restore your data if
your computers were to get infected. There is no single approach that‚Äôs
ideal for everyone, but we can help you think about what‚Äôs involved and
develop a strategy that balances protection, cost, and effort.</p>
