I"â<p>Starting with macOS 10.15.5 Catalina, Apple introduced a <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT211094">battery
health management</a>
feature that improves your batteryâ€™s lifespan by adjusting charging
patterns to reduce the rate at which the battery chemically ages. (Find
it in System Preferences &gt; Energy Saver &gt; Battery Health.) One thing
to be aware of with battery health management is that it might cause
your MacBook to display â€œBattery Is Not Chargingâ€ in the battery status
menu even when itâ€™s plugged in. Thatâ€™s normal, and itâ€™s nothing to worry
about. Of course, if you regularly see that message, itâ€™s a hint that
you may not be using <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201700">the proper power adapter and
cable</a> or that the power
source isnâ€™t delivering enough juice.</p>
