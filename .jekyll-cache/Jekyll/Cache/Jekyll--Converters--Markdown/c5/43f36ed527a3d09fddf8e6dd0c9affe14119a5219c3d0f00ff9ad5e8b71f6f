<p>Itâ€™s easy, particularly when traveling, to end up connecting to a Wi-Fi
network that doesnâ€™t provide Internet access, requires credentials you
donâ€™t have, or lacks access to the networkâ€™s printer. Unfortunately,
once your iPhone, iPad, or Mac has connected to such a network, it may
reconnect to it later, causing consternation when things donâ€™t work. The
solution? Whenever you realize a Wi-Fi network is worthless, forget it.
(The network, that is.) On the Mac, open System Preferences &gt; Network &gt; Wi-Fi &gt; Advanced &gt; Wi-Fi, select the network in the list (you donâ€™t
have to be connected to it), click the â€“ button, and click Remove. On
an iPhone or iPad, when youâ€™re connected to the offending network, go to
Settings &gt; Wi-Fi, tap the i button to the right of the current network,
and tap Forget This Network on the next screen.</p>
