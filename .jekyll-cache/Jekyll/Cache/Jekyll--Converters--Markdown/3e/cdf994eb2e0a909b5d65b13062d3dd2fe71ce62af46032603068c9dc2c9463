I"Ω<p>Do you have a document that you open regularly, perhaps from your
Desktop? If you‚Äôd like to make it stand out from other documents, why
not give it a custom icon? This was common practice on the Mac back in
the day, and it‚Äôs still possible in modern versions of macOS. Go to
<a href="https://images.google.com/" rel="nofollow">Google Images</a> and search for
‚Äú<em>searchTerm</em> icon‚Äù to see what images are available. (It‚Äôs fine to use
any graphic for one-time personal use; if you‚Äôre planning to distribute
the file or publish the icon in any way, make sure to read and honor any
licensing requirements.) Download an image you like (Control-click it
and look for a Save Image command), open it in Preview (where you can
delete any background or crop as desired), press Command-A for Select
All, and Command-C to copy the image. Then select the icon for the file
you want to customize, press Command-I to open its Get Info window,
click the current icon in the upper-left corner (it gets a faint
highlight outline), and press Command-V to paste.</p>
