I"k<p>With so many of us working at home these days, it’s worth remembering
that spouses, children, and housemates may have easy physical access to
your Mac. And, particularly if you share a Mac with them, you might want
to consider how you protect your browsing privacy. Even if you wouldn’t
be embarrassed if your spouse were to see what sites you visited, you
might not want a nosy pre-teen or housemate’s snoopy friend scrolling
through your browser history. Or you may just want to keep research into
someone’s birthday present a secret.</p>

<p>All major Web browsers provide two features to help you protect your
privacy from people who can access your Mac: private browsing and
clearing your browsing history.</p>

<p>After you invoke private browsing, the browser doesn’t store the URLs of
visited pages in your browsing history. This makes it so others can’t go
back through to see where you’ve been. Private browsing also avoids
recording your searches so they don’t pop up for future search
suggestions, doesn’t store the names of downloaded files, and more—the
specifics vary a little by browser. In short, if you ever anticipate
visiting a website that you wouldn’t want someone else with access to
your Mac to know you had visited or don’t want to be embarrassed by a
search suggestion when someone is peering over your shoulder, use
private browsing.</p>

<p>What if you forget, or realize only after you’re done that your browsing
history might reveal something you’d prefer stayed private? In that
case, you’ll want to clear your browsing history, a feature that all
browsers provide.</p>

<p>You should keep two important facts in mind when using these features:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Both of these features are focused on reducing
privacy worries related to someone accessing your Mac. They do not,
for the most part, keep your activities private from your ISP, the
organizations whose websites you access, or advertisers (through ad
trackers).</li>
  <li>Neither of these features is meant to protect
state secrets, sensitive journalistic research, or important
business plans. If you’re interested in that level of security,
contact us for personalized advice about what apps and devices to
use.​</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Invoke Private Browsing</strong></p>

<p>The hardest part of invoking private browsing is merely remembering to
do so. In Safari, Firefox, and Brave, simply choose File &gt; New Private
Window to get a new browser window with private browsing enabled.
Slightly different are Google Chrome, where you choose File &gt; New
Incognito Window, and Microsoft Edge, where the command is File &gt; New
InPrivate Window.</p>

<p>In all cases, the browser alerts you that you’ve enabled private
browsing, are in a private window, or have gone incognito. Safari is the
most subtle (top left, below), whereas Firefox (bottom left, below), and
Chrome (right, below) make it painfully obvious and provide links to
additional information about precisely what is protected and what’s not.</p>

<p>Additional tabs you create in that private browsing window are also
private, so you don’t have to keep making new windows as you browse,
although there’s no problem with opening multiple private windows at
once. The main annoyance of using private browsing is that websites
won’t recognize you or know you’re logged in.</p>

<p>To leave private browsing, simply close that window.​</p>

<p><strong>Clear Browsing History</strong></p>

<p>How you clear browsing history varies by browser. Although they all let
you choose how far back to go, only some give you choices about what
type of data to clear.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Safari:</strong> In Safari, choose History &gt; Clear
History. A pop-up menu lets you clear your history from the last
hour, today, today and yesterday, or all time. Happily, Safari also
clears your history from other devices signed into your iCloud
account.

  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Firefox:</strong> In Firefox, choose History &gt;
Clear Recent History and select the information to remove. You can
clear data from the last hour, two hours, four hours, within the
last day, or everything.

  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Google Chrome:</strong> With Chrome, choose
Chrome &gt; Clear Browsing Data. You can switch between two modes:
Basic and Advanced, the latter of which gives you more control over
exactly what you’re removing. Chrome provides the most flexible time
periods from which to remove data: the last hour, the last 24 hours,
the last 7 days, the 4 weeks, or all time.

  </li>
</ul>

<p>The history clearing interfaces in Brave and Microsoft Edge are similar
to Chrome since those browsers are based on the same underpinnings.
However, both add an On Exit mode that removes the specified types of
data every time you quit. Firefox also offers the option to clear
cookies and site data every time you quit, but remember that doing so
will sign you out of all websites.</p>

<p>In the end, don’t get too caught up in a Spy vs. Spy scenario with your
browsing history. There’s nothing wrong with keeping your birthday
present research private or working to avoid an embarrassing situation
with a search suggestion, but it’s better to have and build trusting
relationships than to worry constantly about someone discovering what
you’re doing.</p>
