I"ü<p>It is true that not all migrations are equal and even truer that issues always arise during a migration that seem to be unique to our server setup that are outside of the general advice put forth by Apple in their knowledgeable articles. Moving the wiki server either to a different operating system or to a different computer is no exception. While I admire Apples attempt at making a Wiki and integrating it with their services, the product itself has been unsupported and buggy from the beginning.</p>
