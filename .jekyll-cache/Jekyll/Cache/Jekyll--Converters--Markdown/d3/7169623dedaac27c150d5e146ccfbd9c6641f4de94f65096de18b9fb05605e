<p>Itâ€™s that time of year again, when an Apple userâ€™s thoughts drift to new
versions of macOS, iOS, watchOS, and tvOS. Apple announced the new
versions in June, and public betas have been available since. But once
Apple makes macOS 10.14 Mojave, iOS 12, watchOS 5, and tvOS 12 available
for free download, youâ€™ll need to decide when to install each.</p>
