I"F<p>I am well aware of how to install and setup SSL certificates in OSX Server but that was not always the case. I am writing this how to for those less experienced who may find this article helpful. There are two types of SSL certificates, that you can use on your OSX Server. Self Signed Certificates are ones that are created on the server and are not digitally verified by a third party service. You can use these certificates to encrypt or secure your servers services but you will ultimately confuse users due to the never ending string of warnings about untrusted certificates. The second type of certificate requires a self signed certificate as the base but then gets verified by a third party service. We use <a href="https://www.godaddy.com/ssl/ssl-certificates.aspx">GoDaddy</a> for our certificates and they work pretty well, there are many other services out there that offer moderately priced certificate verification services that will offer a trusted connection. This type of certificate is transparent to the user and simply encrypts the data without any warning message.</p>
