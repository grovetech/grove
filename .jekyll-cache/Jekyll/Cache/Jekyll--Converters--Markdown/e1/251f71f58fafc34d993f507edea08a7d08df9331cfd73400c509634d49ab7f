I"è<p>Power users like keyboard shortcuts because it‚Äôs faster to press a
couple of keys than to navigate lengthy menus. If you have trouble
remembering shortcuts, check out
<a href="https://www.ergonis.com/products/keycue/" rel="nofollow">KeyCue</a>, which
displays a concise table of all currently available shortcuts. But what
about menu items that lack shortcuts? Make your own in System
Preferences &gt; Keyboard &gt; Shortcuts &gt; App Shortcuts. Click the +
button, choose an app from the Application menu, fill in the Menu Title
field, click the Keyboard Shortcut field, press your desired key
combination, and click Add. You can even make shortcuts for Safari
bookmarks, since they appear in the Bookmarks menu. If a shortcut
doesn‚Äôt work, make sure you typed its menu title exactly right,
including any punctuation like three periods for an ellipsis. To edit an
item, double-click its title or shortcut in the list. If you no longer
want an item, select it and click the ‚Äì
button.</p>
