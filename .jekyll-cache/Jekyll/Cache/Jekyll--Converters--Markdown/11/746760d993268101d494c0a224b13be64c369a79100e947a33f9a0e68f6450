<p>I have been using Macintosh computers for a long time. As long as I can remember its always been said. Macintosh computers are not vulnerable to malicous intent. While malware, spyware and now ransomware plaque the Windows and Linux landscape, Mac had always been a trusted alternative. In fact Apple themselves highlighted this very sentiment during their, ‚ÄúIm a Mac‚Äù commercial campaign, which ran many years ago.</p>

<p>We live in a very different world now. Macintosh computers are just as vulnerable to malicous attacks. Spyware and ransomware can affect both PC and Mac computers alike and the once stable platform that we all knew and trusted has become less secure. Less secure obviously detracts from the experience that many people buy a Mac computer for in the first place, which is frustrating for many that turn from their ravaged past with their PC to a Mac; only to be greeted with the same annoying problems.</p>

<h2 id="what-problems">What problems?</h2>

<p>With a lack of a secure platform, Mac computers have started the same annoying and much needed patching and update cycle. There is some solace in the automatic update feature however it only patches the operating system and leaves the job of security and application security management to third party developers. Many of whom are novices at best when it comes to application programing. What does this all mean. It means that while you have a sense of security by constantly updating your machine, its a false one at best.</p>

<p>In the past users were left to update their Mac, and hope that the update didn‚Äôt break or cause issues. Many people have found themselves wanting to revert after a bad update. Even Apple recommends and suggests backing up before updating so that you can go back if it doesn‚Äôt work out.</p>

<p>What if there was a company that downloaded all of Apple‚Äôs updates and tested them first? What if there was a company that downloaded and tested every version of over 50+ popular freeware software titles? Well‚Ä¶ now there is.</p>
