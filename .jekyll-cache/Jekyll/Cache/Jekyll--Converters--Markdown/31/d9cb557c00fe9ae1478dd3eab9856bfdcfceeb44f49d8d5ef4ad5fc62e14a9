I" <p>Apple recently released iOS 13.5, incorporating a new Exposure
Notification API in response to the global COVID-19 pandemic. We’ve seen
a few people freaking out about this, but seriously, calm down, folks.
At best, the Exposure Notification API could lower contact tracing
costs, reduce the spread of COVID-19, prevent life-changing health
consequences, and save lives. At worst, it won’t prove particularly
effective. In neither case does it pose any threat to personal privacy.</p>

<p>Why have Apple and Google—two companies that normally compete tooth
and nail—formed this unprecedented partnership? Contact tracing is one
of the key techniques employed by public health authorities in slowing
the spread of COVID-19. It involves gathering information from an
infected person about those they’ve been in contact with, enabling
authorities to learn who might have been the source of the infection and
who they may have infected. It’s a slow, laborious, and error-prone
process—do you know or even remember all the people you’ve come in
contact with over the past few weeks?—but it’s helpful nonetheless.</p>

<p>To speed up this process and make it more accurate, Apple and Google are
building exposure notification capabilities into their respective
smartphone operating systems. A large percentage of the population
carries a smartphone running either iOS or Android, and since these
phones have the capability to detect when other phones are in their
vicinity via Bluetooth, Apple and Google realized they could use
technology to alert people when they had been exposed to a person who
later tests positive for COVID-19.</p>

<p>Their solution comes in two phases. In the first phase, Apple and Google
are releasing the Exposure Notification API, and that’s what just
happened with iOS 13.5. This API, or application programming interface,
allows apps written by public health authorities to work across both iOS
and Android devices, something that’s never been possible before. <strong>The
first key fact to understand is that only public health authorities will
be allowed to write apps that leverage the Exposure Notification API.</strong>
It cannot be incorporated into sketchy social media apps.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, it seems likely that many people will never learn about
or download those apps. So in the second phase, Apple and Google will
build the exposure notification technology directly into iOS and
Android, so it can work without a public health authority app being
installed.</p>

<p><strong>The second key fact to understand is the entire system is opt-in.</strong>
You must explicitly consent to the terms and conditions of the program
before it becomes active on your phone. That’s true whether you get an
app in the first phase or rely on the integration in the second phase.
And, of course, if you change your mind, you can always turn it off in
the app or the operating system settings.</p>

<p>How does it work? Apple and Google have developed an ingenious approach
that ensures that those who opt-in to the technology can use it without
worrying about privacy violations.</p>

<p>Your phone creates a Bluetooth beacon with a unique ID derived from a
randomly generated diagnosis encryption key. The system generates a
fresh diagnosis key every 24 hours and stores it on your phone for 14
days, deleting all older keys. Plus, the unique Bluetooth beacon ID that
your phone broadcasts to other phones in your vicinity changes every 15
minutes. Similarly, your phone reads the unique IDs from nearby phones
and stores them locally. This approach ensures privacy in three
important ways:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>No personal information is shared.</strong> The ID
is based on a random encryption key and changes constantly, so
there’s no way it could be traced back to your phone, much less to
you personally.</li>
  <li><strong>No location information is stored.</strong> The only
data that’s generated and transferred between the phones are these
unique IDs. The system does not record or share location
information, and Apple and Google have said they won’t approve any
public health authority app that uses this system and also records
location separately.</li>
  <li><strong>No data is uploaded unless you test
positive.</strong> As long as you remain uninfected by COVID-19, no data
from your phone is uploaded to the Apple- and Google-controlled
servers.</li>
</ul>

<p>What happens if you test positive for COVID-19? (Sorry!) In that case,
you would need to use a public health authority app to report your test
results. You’ll likely have to enter a code or other piece of
information to validate the diagnosis—a requirement necessary to
prevent fake reporting.</p>

<p>When the app confirms your diagnosis, it triggers your phone to upload
up to the last 14 days of diagnosis encryption keys—remember, these
are just the keys from which the IDs are derived, not the IDs
themselves—to the servers. Fewer days might be uploaded depending on
when the exposure could have occurred.</p>

<p>All the phones enrolled in the system constantly download these
diagnosis keys from devices of infected people. Then they perform
cryptographic operations to see if those keys match any of the locally
stored Bluetooth IDs captured during the period covered by the key. If
there’s a match, that means you were in proximity to an infected person,
and the system generates a notification with information about the day
the exposure happened, how long it lasted, and the Bluetooth signal
strength (which can indicate how close you were). A public health
authority app will provide detailed instructions on how to proceed; if
someone doesn’t have the app yet, the smartphone operating system will
explain how to get it. Additional privacy protections are built into
these steps:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>No one is forced to report a positive
diagnosis.</strong> Just as you have to opt-in to the proximity ID sharing,
you must explicitly choose to share your positive diagnosis. Not
sharing puts others, including your loved ones, at risk, but that’s
your decision to make.</li>
  <li><strong>Shared diagnosis keys cannot identify you.</strong>
The information that your phone uploads in the case of a positive
diagnosis is limited to—at most—14 encryption keys. Those keys,
which are then shared with others’ phones, contain no personal or
location information.</li>
  <li><strong>The matching process takes place only on
users’ phones.</strong> Since the diagnosis keys and the derived IDs only
meet on individual phones, there’s no way Apple, Google, or any
government agency could match them up to establish a relationship.</li>
  <li><strong>The notification information is too general
to identify individuals.</strong> In most cases, there will be no way to
connect an exposure notification back to an individual. Obviously,
if you were in contact with only one or two people on a relevant
day, that’s less true, but in such a situation, they’re likely known
to you anyway.</li>
</ul>

<p>Finally, Apple and Google have said they’ll disable the exposure
notification system on a regional basis when it is no longer needed.</p>

<p>We apologize if that sounds complicated. It is, and necessarily so,
because Apple and Google have put a tremendous amount of thought and
technical and cryptographic experience into developing this exposure
notification system. They are the preeminent technology companies on the
planet, and their knowledge, skills, and expertise are as good as it
gets. A simpler system—and, unfortunately, we’ll probably see plenty
of other apps that won’t be as well designed—would likely have
loopholes or could be exploited in unanticipated ways.</p>

a FAQ and the technical specifications.</p>

<p>Our take? We’ll be installing the necessary app and participating in
this exposure notification system. It’s the least we can do to help keep
our loved ones and others in our communities safe. In a pandemic, we all
have to work to help others.</p>
