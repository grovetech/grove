I"∏<p>In a widely expected update, Apple has introduced a new MacBook Air that
replaces the much-maligned butterfly keyboard with the new Magic
Keyboard. The MacBook Air also gains faster processors, enhanced
graphics, and more storage options, all for $200 less than before.</p>

<p>Apple also threw back the curtains on an updated iPad Pro that will be
compatible with a new iPad Pro-specific Magic Keyboard that includes a
trackpad. The iPad Pro is available now, but the Magic Keyboard won‚Äôt
ship until May.</p>

<p>In an effort to eliminate the hated butterfly keyboard from the Mac
line, Apple has released an updated <a href="https://www.apple.com/macbook-air/" rel="nofollow">MacBook
Air</a> that features the
scissor-key Magic Keyboard introduced last year in the 16-inch MacBook
Pro. That keyboard has received highly positive reviews, and we‚Äôre happy
to see it appear in the MacBook Air. (Look for a new model to replace
the current 13-inch MacBook Pro soon as well.) The Magic Keyboard
includes 12 function keys as well as a Touch ID sensor, but no Touch
Bar.</p>

<p>Apple significantly improved the MacBook Air‚Äôs performance by providing a
choice of 10th-generation Intel Core processors, including the model‚Äôs
first quad-core processor option. The base level 1.1 GHz dual-core Intel
Core i3 is probably pretty slow, but upgrading to a 1.1 GHz quad-core i5
is only $100 and a 1.2 GHz quad-core i7 is just $250.</p>

<p>Graphics should be noticeably speedier as well, thanks to the switch to
Intel Iris Plus Graphics. The MacBook Air can now drive a 6K display
too, if you have a Pro Display XDR.</p>

<p>Apple also doubled the base level of storage to 256 GB, and you can
increase that to 512 GB ($200), 1 TB ($400), or 2 TB ($800).</p>

<p>Minor enhancements include True Tone technology for more natural images
on the 13-inch Retina display, ‚Äúwide stereo sound‚Äù for the speakers, and
support for Bluetooth 5.0.</p>

<p>As welcome as all these changes are, the best news is that Apple
simultaneously dropped the MacBook Air‚Äôs price. The entry-level model
now starts at $999, and it‚Äôs available to the education market for just
$899.</p>

<h3 id="ipad-pro">iPad Pro</h3>

<p>We were waiting for the Magic Keyboard to come to the MacBook Air, but
we had no inkling that Apple was going to add a trackpad option to the
iPad Pro. It will come in the form of the new Magic Keyboard, due in
May, and will require iPadOS 13.4, slated for late March. Apple says it
will be easy to use, with the pointer transforming to highlight user
elements appropriately as the user moves their finger across the
trackpad. What it won‚Äôt be is cheap, at $299 for the 11-inch model and
$349 for the 12.9-inch model. (The second-generation Apple Pencil and
an updated Smart Keyboard Folio remain available.)</p>

<p>The other unexpected change in the new iPad Pro is the addition of the
new LiDAR Scanner. LiDAR (light detection and ranging) is a way of
measuring distance with reflected laser light. It‚Äôs commonly used in
self-driving cars, but Apple is instead using it to beef up the iPad
Pro‚Äôs augmented reality (AR) capabilities. It offers existing ARKit apps
instant AR placement, improved motion capture, and people occlusion.
Apple also uses it to improve the Measure app. We can‚Äôt help but think
Apple is testing the technology for future AR goggles.</p>

<p>Less surprising improvements include a new processor‚ÄîApple‚Äôs custom
A12Z Bionic chip‚Äîand a dual-camera system that combines a 12-megapixel
wide camera and a 10-megapixel ultra-wide camera that zooms out two
times to capture a much wider field of view. The iPad Pro also now
boasts five microphones for capturing audio and four speakers that
automatically adjust to any orientation.</p>

<p>Pricing for the iPad Pro itself hasn‚Äôt changed. The 11-inch model starts
at $799, with the 12.9-inch model at $999. Both come with 128 GB of
flash storage, up from 64 GB in the previous models, and you can buy
more storage: 256 GB (add $100), 512 GB ($300), or 1 TB ($500).
Cellular connectivity costs an extra $150.</p>

<h3 id="mac-mini">Mac mini</h3>

<p>Last and indeed least, Apple announced that the standard configurations
of the Mac mini now have twice as much storage as before. That means the
$799 configuration comes with 256 GB and the $1099 configuration comes
with 512 GB. 1 TB and 2TB configurations remain available, and there are
no other changes.</p>
