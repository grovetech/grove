I"‡<p>Snazzy shadowed text probably isnâ€™t appropriate for your companyâ€™s annual report, but if youâ€™re whipping up a flyer for a birthday party, you might want to jazz up the text. You can do that in most Mac apps that support macOSâ€™s system-level Fonts palette.</p>

<p>Select your text, and then bring up the Fonts palette. Generally speaking, such as in Pages and TextEdit, you do that by choosing Format &gt; Font &gt; Show Fonts, though the exact location may vary by app.</p>

<p>Then click the shadowed T button toward the right of the toolbar, which activates the next four controls: Shadow Opacity, Shadow Blur, Shadow Offset, and Shadow Angle. Play with each slider and the rotating angle control until you have an effect you like.</p>
