<p>Don’t panic it’s not any link it’s a specific link to a github page “iabem97.github.io” if you received this link via the Messages app on your iPhone or iPad they can crash or restart, and the Messages app then becomes unusable.</p>

<p>Interestingly the link can cause problems on both iDevices (iPads &amp; iPhones) as well as Macs. Just receiving the link can cause issues due to the way the messages App creates a preview of any links sent in messages.</p>

<p>If you receive the link or a similar link with the same effects the only solution is to quit the App and then immediately delete the entire conversation thread.</p>

<p>Bugs sent via messages like this are not new and several similar bugs have cropped up in the past, it’s best not to send them on to friends as a gag as it can cause the device to restart.
These bugs are not serious as they do not cause any lasting damage to the device and are often distributed as a way to wind up friends and colleagues.</p>

<p>To delete the entire thread on your iPhone / iPad , swipe left on the conversation and the press delete. You have to delete the entire conversation as opening the conversation thread to delete a single message can cause the device to crash or restart.</p>

<p>On the Mac open the Messages App from Applications and right click on the conversation and select delete:</p>

<p>Apple has announced an update to iOS which will be version 11.2.5 that will fix this bug in case it surfaces again.</p>

<p>iOS 11.2.5 will also include an update to Siri which will allow news podcasts to be played from various sources including CNN and Fox News.</p>

<p>The page on github that contained the link has since been updated and will no longer cause a crash or restart so you don’t need to take any steps to prevent iOS devices or Macs accessing github.</p>
