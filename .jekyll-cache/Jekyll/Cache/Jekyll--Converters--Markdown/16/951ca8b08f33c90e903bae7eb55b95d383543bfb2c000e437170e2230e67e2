I"<p>Imagine you‚Äôre staring at a file or folder‚Äîperhaps confidential
employee information that you need to send to your accountant. If
attaching it to an email message makes you think, ‚ÄúThat doesn‚Äôt seem
like a good idea,‚Äù award yourself a gold star!</p>

<p>Sending sensitive files via email is a bad idea, partly because the
email could be intercepted in transit (possible but highly unlikely),
but more because the files then live in both your and your recipient‚Äôs
email accounts in an unprotected form. If an attacker were to gain
access to either of your email accounts, they might scan for patterns
like credit card numbers, ID numbers, phone numbers, and postal
addresses and find them even in attachments.</p>

<p>There are ways of encrypting email messages so they can be read only by
the recipient and never exist in an unencrypted form other than while
being created or read, but they‚Äôre difficult to set up and fussy to use.
For most people, most of the time, encrypted email is overkill.</p>

<p>For a more straightforward solution to exchanging information securely
via email, use password-protected and encrypted ZIP archives. They‚Äôre
easy to create on the Mac, either using a simple command in Terminal or
with a third-party utility. And better yet, any Mac user can expand them
using the built-in Archive Utility simply by double-clicking and
entering the necessary password.‚Äã</p>

<h3 id="create-encrypted-zip-archive-using-terminal">Create Encrypted ZIP Archive Using Terminal</h3>

<p>Although many Mac users are intimidated by using the Unix command line
in Terminal, making an encrypted ZIP archive is easy enough for anyone.
All it takes is typing a single command, dragging a file or folder to
Terminal, and entering a password twice. Follow these steps, which make
an encrypted ZIP archive on your Desktop:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>In your Applications folder, open the Utilities folder and
double-click Terminal to launch it.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Type (or copy and paste) this command, replacing ‚ÄúarchiveName‚Äù with
whatever you want to name the ZIP file and making sure to type a
space after the last letter‚Äîthe ‚Äúp‚Äù in ‚Äúzip‚Äù. (The tilde ~
character is Shift-backtick, and it‚Äôs the key to the left of the
numeral 1 key.)</p>

    <p>zip -er ~/Desktop/archiveName.zip</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Drag the file or folder you want to protect into the Terminal window
to complete the command.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>34  Press Return, and when prompted, enter the desired password
    twice‚Äîthe second time is for confirmation.</p>

<h3 id="create-encrypted-zip-archive-using-archiver">Create Encrypted ZIP Archive Using Archiver</h3>

<p>If you have trouble with the command-line method or plan to create
encrypted ZIP archives regularly, it‚Äôs worth using a Mac app that
simplifies the process even more. There are various apps, but a
particularly straightforward one for those running macOS 11 Big Sur is
<a href="https://archiverapp.com/">Archiver</a> ($19.99, with a free trial).
Download it and then follow these steps to create an encrypted ZIP
archive:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Launch Archiver.

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Drag a file or folder to the Archiver window and click the Archive
button in the toolbar.

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Select the archive format (use ZIP), click the Encrypt checkbox,
enter the password twice, and click the Archive button in the
toolbar.

  <li>
    <p>Drag the ZIP archive to the Desktop or another folder and click the
Done button.

<h3 id="decrypting-a-zip-archive">Decrypting a ZIP Archive</h3>

<p>As noted earlier, decrypting a password-protected ZIP archive on the Mac
is as simple as double-clicking it and entering the password when
prompted.</p>

<p><img alt="Blog Photo" src="https://grovetech.co/assets/img/blog/2021/20210901Ne/image7.png" class="img-fluid rounded m-2" width="700" /></p>

<p>What about iOS or iPadOS? Never fear, since the Files app can also
decrypt ZIP archives; just tap the archive to open it and enter the
password when prompted.</p>

<p><img alt="Blog Photo" src="https://grovetech.co/assets/img/blog/2021/20210901Ne/image8.png" class="img-fluid rounded m-2" width="700" /></p>

<h3 id="a-word-about-passwords">A Word about Passwords</h3>

<p>It‚Äôs important to think briefly about how you‚Äôre going to communicate
the password to your recipient. Don‚Äôt send it in email or else anyone
who compromises either your email account or your recipient‚Äôs account
could decrypt the ZIP archive.</p>

<p>Instead, use what‚Äôs called an ‚Äúout of band‚Äù communication channel. In
other words, if you‚Äôre going to send the ZIP archive via email,
communicate the password in a phone call or text message. That would
keep the password safe if either of your email accounts were
compromised.</p>

<p>If you‚Äôre sending password-protected ZIP archives to a particular person
regularly (and the files don‚Äôt contain state or corporate secrets), you
could agree on a system for generating passwords so you don‚Äôt have to
communicate each one individually. For instance, you could combine a
random word and the current month, so the password would be
‚Äúcheddar9September‚Äù one month and ‚Äúcheddar10October‚Äù the next.</p>

<p>As you can see, you can use this technique with so little extra effort
that it‚Äôs worth ensuring a higher level of security whenever you need to
share confidential information.</p>
