I"d<p>The App Library in iOS 14 ensures that you can find all the apps
installed on your iPhone without having to hunt through Home screens. So
if you already have a lot of Home screens that contain a random
assemblage of apps, it might be easier to hide those screens than to
remove all the apps on them. To do this in iOS 14, touch and hold any
empty spot on the Home screen to enter jiggle mode. Then tap the lozenge
around the dots that represent your Home screens. In the Edit Pages
screen, tap the checkmark under any Home screen to hide it (or tap an
empty circle to add a checkmark and show that Home screen). To save your
changes, tap Done. As a bonus tip, notice that swiping on that lozenge
of Home screen dots is now a quick way to navigate between the Home
screens.</p>
