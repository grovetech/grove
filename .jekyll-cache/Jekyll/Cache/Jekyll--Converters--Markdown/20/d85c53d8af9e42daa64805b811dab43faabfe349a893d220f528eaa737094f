I"ð<p>A client got in touch recently with a maddening problem. When he received texts on his iPhone, Messages displayed notifications for messages from everyoneâ€¦except his wife! Needless to say, this was a problem. Since notifications appeared correctly for other people, it wasnâ€™t related to overall settings. It turned out that heâ€”or someone else, or iOS gremlinsâ€”had inadvertently enabled the Hide Alerts switch for the Messages conversation with his wife. To fix it, all he had to do was display the conversation in Messages, tap the i button at the upper right, and disable Hide Alerts. (In the Mac version of Messages, click the Details button and look for the Do Not Disturb checkbox.) Itâ€™s a good feature designed to let you mute a chatty group conversation, but it can cause stress if applied to the wrong conversation accidentally.</p>
