I"z	<p>Today more than ever it is important to keep your computers up to date to safeguard from security vulnerabilities that hackers and cybercriminals might use to attack or gain entry to your computer files and confidential data. Apple has made this process easier through software notifications that you can receive automatically to install updates. You can also make upgrades automatically if you like. If you receive a notification that software updates are available, you can choose when to install the updates, or choose to be reminded the next day. Here’s how.</p>
