<p>While retail as a whole has taken a major hit with well known chains like Macy’s cutting jobs and closing stores, others declaring bankruptcy and many shoppers turning to Amazon increasingly, Apple has chosen to reinvest in retail. 2015 was a difficult year for iPhone sales in the U.S. with only <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/apple-stores-see-shrinking-share-of-iphone-sales-1460126178">11% of Americans buying new phones</a> at Apple Stores and majority of consumers going directly to their telecommunication providers, usually with low-cost leasing deals tied to longer contracts. Apple’s primary sales have been direct through their website, second only to Amazon.</p>

<p>Despite this, retail is pivotal to Apple strategy with CEO Tim Cook stating on numerous occasions that Apple Stores are more than just places to browse new gadget and fix broken devices. Spearheading this initiative is Angela Ahrendts, former CEO of Burberry known for revitalizing the older iconic British brand and making it relevant and appealing to a wide audience, while <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100911195704/https://magazine.wsj.com/features/the-big-interview/earning-her-strips/">tripling its value.</a></p>

<p>In fact, Apple Stores have greater <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/retails-most-profitable-square-footage-636947493.html">sales per square foot</a> than any other retailer in the world, even more than high-end jewelry stores and car dealerships. Each square foot of Apple Store real estate translated to $5,546 in annual sales in 2017.</p>
