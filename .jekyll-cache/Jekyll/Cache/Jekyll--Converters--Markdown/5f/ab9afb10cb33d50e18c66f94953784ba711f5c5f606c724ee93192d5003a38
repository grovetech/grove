I"c<p>So like many other organizations mine was finally fed up with Horde as a webmail system. They had used squirrel mail in the past and was unimpressed by the graphical interface but admitted that it while it lacked glamour it always did perform as they would have expected. Before I had started there their mail system was running on a Linux box using Plesk and running Horde as their primary webmail interface. Immediately I got them into an XServe running OSX mail since their entire organization consisted of Apple iMacs figured it was the way to go, and got them setup with Squirrelmail and Roundcube.</p>
