I"Ú<p>If you have lots of apps on your iPhone or iPad, rearranging their icons
on your Home screens by dragging from page to page is tedious. Although
the new App Library promised for iOS 14 later this year will help you
find apps, rearranging them will still be a manual process. To make
organizing your Home screens easier, try using the Dock as a temporary
shelf. Touch and hold on any icon and then tap Edit Home Screen (or just
start dragging) to start all the icons wiggling. Then, navigate to your
rightmost Home screen and drag one icon off the Dock temporarily. Now,
for other icons you want to move between screens, drag the icon to the
Dock, swipe quickly to view the desired screen, and then drag the icon
off the Dock into the position you want. When youâ€™re done, put your
original Dock icon back and swipe up (on Face ID devices) or press the
Home button (on Touch ID devices) to stop the icons from wiggling.</p>
