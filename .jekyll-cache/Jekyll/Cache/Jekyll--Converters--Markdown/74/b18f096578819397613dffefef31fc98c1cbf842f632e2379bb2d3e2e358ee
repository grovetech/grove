I"‚<p>If youâ€™ve turned on automatic App Updates in Settings &gt; App Store on
your iPhone or iPad, you might wonder how youâ€™d know if an app was
updated or what changed. To find that information, open the App Store
app and tap your avatar icon in the upper-right corner. Scroll down and
youâ€™ll see an Updated Recently list. If you pull down on the screen,
that will force it to refresh, and you may see a list called Upcoming
Automatic Updates at the top. For any downloaded update, you can tap
Open to open it. If it hasnâ€™t yet been downloaded, you can tap Update to
update it right away rather than waiting for the automatic update. Tap
More to see the full release notes. Finally, hereâ€™s a hidden tip: swipe
left on any app to delete it.</p>
