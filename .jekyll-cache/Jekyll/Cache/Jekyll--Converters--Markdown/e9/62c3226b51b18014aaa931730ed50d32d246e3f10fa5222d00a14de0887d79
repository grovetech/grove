I"÷<p>If your like me then your happy that Apple has made several of their wonderful software titles free recently, specifically iLife and iWork for Mavericks. Apple has a defined workflow for deployment of these systems. Their method is to have companies enroll into their <a href="https://www.apple.com/business/vpp/">Volume Licensing Program</a> once enrolled you can download apps from the app store and the iOS store and deploy these seamlessly to your devices with Profile Manager for Mavericks.</p>
