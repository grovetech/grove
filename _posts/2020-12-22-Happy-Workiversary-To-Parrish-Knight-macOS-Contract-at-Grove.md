We want to take a moment to recognize the 1 year workiversary of Parrish Knight. Parrish joined us with the hopes to help us grow our remote support base for small to startup sized companies. Unfortunately 2020 dealt us a blow and we did not grow as much in that sector as we had hoped. Regardless Parrish pitched in and stuck with us throughout the year and for that we are extremely grateful.

His attention to detail and ability to work across multiple sectors is impressive and his attentive demeanor and customer first approach to customer service makes him a wonderful addition to our team. Lets take a moment to learn a little bit more about Parrish and how he came to be here at Grove!
					
### Tell us about yourself, your history of how you got started with Systems Engineering and how you got to where you are today.

> I started off messing around with computers when I was a boy, teaching myself programming and experimenting with modifying operating systems.  Eventually, just through sheer experimentation, I saw that I was getting good at it and ended up making it a career.

### What first drew you to Grove Technologies and what have you learned and how have you grown since you have worked here?

> I originally found Grove when they placed an advertisement on one of the job boards.  I especially enjoy the feeling that I’m doing most of the same technical stuff I do for myself at home every day anyway but also being able to use my talents to help others!  I often talk with the other techs about the tools we use for our job and so on.

### Talk about the directions you hope to go in the future in terms of career development, what certifications are you interested in, and why..

> I would like to get my macOS Catalina cert because, although I do have an Apple cert, it’s starting to show its age.  I’m also pursuing my Windows 10 Desktop Administrator certification because it will be good for my “day job”.

### What is your overall motivation for doing the work that you do and how do you want to change the world for the better?

> I’ve always enjoyed tinkering with computers, and since there are always people out there who need help with the ever-increasing complexity of computers and the networks they’re connected to, I use my skills to help other people keep their arrangements running smoothly so they’re able to make their own contribution to the world as well. 

### What do you like to do outside of work, passions, hobbies, interests?

> I’m a science enthusiast, particularly space exploration, and I also attend fan conventions regularly.  I practice my penny whistle when I can work up the motivation, and I’m a voracious reader.  I’m also a First Amendment activist and put in work there as well when I can find the time!
