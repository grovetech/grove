We want to take a moment to welcome Mikaela Donelan. Mikaela our new Client Success & Project Manager, hails from Minnesota and brings with her a wealth of knowlege and experience. Mikaela partners with clients to develop strategic solutions for their business needs. During project development, she is the voice of our clients; providing a quality customer experience. 

We are excited to put her to work and to see what she can do and on that note.... Lets take a moment to learn a little bit more about Mikaela and how she came to be here at Grove!

### Tell us about yourself, your history of how you got started with Client Success & Project Management and how you got to where you are today.

> Hey! My name is Mikaela Donelan - a world traveler and strategic thinker among many other skills and attributes. During my career, I’ve been a marketing specialist, brand strategist and Project Manager. As my career progressed, I continued to find myself naturally stepping into PM roles. With all of my past roles, some of my favorite memories were my interactions with clients - sharing the joy of a project well done.
>
> When I found the Client Success and Project Manager role with Grove, I was immediately intrigued by the combination of being an advocate for clients and also getting to wear a project manager hat. 

### What first drew you to Grove Technologies and what are your expectations in terms of opportunities and growth?

> What first drew me to Grove Technologies was that it’s a growing start up that is genuinely centered around clients and their current and future needs. Jon (the CEO) talked heavily about transparency with clients and holding high success rates, which is how I like to approach client success. 
>
> My expectation for myself in this position is to grow as Grove Technologies grows. My role is diverse and I expect to continue to fine tune my skills in Project Management, Client Success and Sales/Marketing to lay a reliable and efficient foundation for Grove Technologies to make leaps and bounds in offering new services to current and future clients.  

### Talk about the directions you hope to go in the future in terms of career development, what certifications are you interested in, and why..
> Over the course of the next couple years, I plan to obtain my PMP (Project Management Professional) certification, along with becoming well versed in IT, network, and cybersecurity solutions. 

### What is your overall motivation for doing the work that you do and how do you want to change the world for the better?
> My overall motivation for my position is to truly become a partner to our clients. There is no better feeling than helping a client reach their goals and building natural trust and comradery. 

### What do you like to do outside of work, passions, hobbies, interests?
> What don’t I like to do?! I’ve traveled the world fairly extensively - over 30 countries - while working as a marketing consultant. Through these travels, I’ve gained knowledge of and experienced a plortha of cultures, ways of thinking and living, foods, languages, and so much more. I also enjoy reading, keeping up with international friends, hosting dinner parties, trekking, exploring new restaurants, going to concerts (pre-pandemic of course!), meditation, being a life coach to family and friends, brand strategy consulting, and more. 

### Anything else you want to add?
> I’m a big believer that there isn’t a problem we can’t solve when we empathize with each other and let go of our own egos.
