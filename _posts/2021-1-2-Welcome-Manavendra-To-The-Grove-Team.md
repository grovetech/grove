We want to take a moment to welcome Manavendra to the Grove Team! Manavendra an MIT Grad has worked for several notable organizations such as the IMF and others to help provide top notch cybersecurity engineering, Mac and PC engineering services. Manavendra has joined us with the hopes to help us provide better engineering services to our clients and broad oversight of our technical project management processes.  

We are excited to put him to work and to see what he can do and on that note.... Lets take a moment to learn a little bit more about Manavendra and how he came to be here at Grove!
					
### Tell us about yourself, your history of how you got started with Systems Engineering and how you got to where you are today.

> Somewhere along the way, I stumbled into the engineer’s credo: The solution is sacred. If something is broken, fix it. If a system is working well, try to learn from it and then optimize it — for the benefit of its users, stakeholders, and society, in that order.

### What first drew you to Grove Technologies and what have you learned and how have you grown since you have worked here?

> After 20+ years, there’s still plenty to learn and opportunities to serve, and to help customers — from individuals to small and medium sized businesses to enterprises — make the most of their investment into Apple technologies.

### Talk about the directions you hope to go in the future in terms of career development, what certifications are you interested in, and why..

> Learning is a way of life, especially in this business. In the short term, I’d like to formalize what I already know (e.g. Jamf 400 certification). In the medium and longer term, I’m following and observing developments in artificial intelligence and machine learning, to see whether this can benefit actual users in the real world.

### What is your overall motivation for doing the work that you do and how do you want to change the world for the better?

> I think my greatest motivation is to help clients increase and fortify their cybersecurity baseline against threat actors.  Cybersecurity is a really challenging and complex issue that can impact clients with things such as ransomware, spear phishing, and failed compliance findings that can have adversarial impact on both the organization and the defense industrial base for certain segments.  I see myself as helping to defend and increase company cybersecurity baselines amid this ever changing landscape.  

### What do you like to do outside of work, passions, hobbies, interests?

> In my carefree days, I used to travel to film festivals to watch arthouse films. Now that I’m an empty nester, and after the pandemic ends, I’d like to rediscover past passions and engage new ones. I’d love to fly model rockets again, just to feel the thrill of pressing the launch button. Maybe I’ll finally get to try ballooning one of these days. My student violin sits in the corner, balefully waiting for me to pick it up again.
