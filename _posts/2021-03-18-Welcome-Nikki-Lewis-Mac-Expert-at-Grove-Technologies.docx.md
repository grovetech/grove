We want to take a moment to welcome Nikki Lewis. Nikki our new Mac Expert, hails from Maryland and brings with her a wealth of knowlege and experience. As an Apple At Home employee, Nikki rose to the level of manager and mentored a team of amazing technicians including our one and only Tiara Thornton. She successfully led a team of iOS support professionals that were on the front lines day in and day out for Apple manning their Applecare support lines.

We are excited to put her to work and to see what she can do and on that note.... Lets take a moment to learn a little bit more about Mikaela and how she came to be here at Grove!

### Tell us about yourself, your history of how you got started with Mac Support and how you got to where you are today.

> I started as an iOS advisor at my previous employer. I was chosen to
> learn how to learn how to troubleshoot Macs. Once training completed, I
> became a TL where I had the opportunity to train new advisors how to not
> only provide the best experience to the customer, but to also sound
> knowledgeable and confident in their role as they prepared to advance in
> their career with the company.
> 
> Now, I have the opportunity to provide the same experience with the
> clients to build a lasting relationship.

### What first drew you to Grove Technologies and what are your expectations in terms of opportunities and growth?

> What drew me to Grove Technologies was being presented with the
> opportunity of doing what I love and being part of a new and growing
> company.
> 
> As we continue to grow and expand, I hope to be given the opportunity to
> help others to be successful and help them on their career journey.

### What first drew me to Grove Technologies was that it's a growing start up that is genuinely centered around clients and their current and future needs.

> Jon (the CEO) talked heavily about transparency with clients and holding
> high success rates, which is how I like to approach client success.

### Talk about the directions you hope to go in the future in terms of career development, what certifications are you interested in, and why.

> I am interested in supporting the clients in every capacity. I plan to
> increase my knowledge by becoming certified with Apple and to also
> expand my certification to Microsoft. Learning is the key in being able
> to provide the most memorable experience and sounding knowledgeable
> while doing it.

### What is your overall motivation for doing the work that you do and how do you want to change the world for the better?

> My motivation for working in the tech field is learning how things work
> and being able to think outside the box to create solutions that are
> easy to understand when reproducing it. Simplicity helps those that are
> not tech savvy to understand the why behind the what.

### What do you like to do outside of work, passions, hobbies, interests?

> When I am not at work I love spending time with my family, especially my
> grandchildren. I also love reading and writing, and watching movies. I
> am looking forward to traveling and discovering new places to fall in
> love with.

### Anything else you want to add?

> I am looking forward to joining the team and helping our clients to
> discover new ways in helping their business grow and run as smoothly as
> possible.
